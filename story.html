<p class='Para'><i><b>"Charmander, I choose you!"</i></b></p>
<p class='Para'><i><b>Shadow planted </i></b>his foot on the dirt battlefield, ready to begin his first Pok&#233;mon battle. He gripped his brown leather belt and picked up a shiny, red-and-white sphere; his new Pok&#233;mon partner's Pok&#233;ball. With a great force, he threw it across the dirt, and it bounced on the ground. A dazzling white light revealed a flame-orange salamander that stood on two legs. A fire burned intensely on the tip of its tapering tail, telling its Trainer it was raring to fight.</p>
<p class='Para'>On the other half of the battlefield was a different Trainer; Shadow's opponent. With a similar velocity, he let loose a Pok&#233;ball as well, revealing a small, bipedal, teal-colored tortoise with a bright orange shell that Shadow recognized as a Squirtle. <i>A Water-type against a Fire-type, </i>Shadow thought. <i>We're at a type disadvantage. But I won't let that stop me!</i></p>
<p class='Para'>"Charmander, use Ember!" Shadow confidently commanded, eager to begin the fight. Charmander inhaled a large volume of air, and just as quickly expelled a bright spark of fire from its mouth that traveled across the battlefield and directly struck the Squirtle. "That's how you do it, Charmander, great job!"</p>
<p class='Para'>Suddenly a quiet voice started speaking into Shadow's ear. Taking his eyes off of the battle, he strained to hear it. It sounded as if it was saying "wake up".</p>
<p class='Para'>Shadow instantaneously opened his real-world eyes. Squinting from sunlight peering in through a window, he made out his own bedroom; a small, rectangular space filled with many Pok&#233;mon-related dolls, plushies, and other accessories. On the floor, next to his bed, lay a broken, Pok&#233;ball-shaped alarm clock. Directly to the left of it was his father, standing in the doorway, saying something.</p>
<p class='Para'>"Shadow, I thought you said that when you turned ten, you would start waking yourself up," he said concernedly.</p>
<p class='Para'>Shadow snapped out of his half-awake state. "I'm late for Professor Oak's ceremony!" he spoke aloud. Without bothering to get dressed he skedaddled through the doorway and down the stairs, tripping on one of them and comically falling. "Ow," he groaned as he got up, but he paid no heed and sprinted out of the house.</p>
<p class='Para'>Professor Oak's laboratory wasn't too far from Shadow's house. As he climbed the grassy hill that led to it, Shadow found himself wondering how he had let this happen. <i>Of course! When I threw Charmander's Pok&#233;ball in my dream, I actually threw my alarm clock. Why did I do that? </i>He arrived at the summit in record time. Ahead of him was the lab&mdash;a large, multi-story science center&mdash;and just outside of its grand front door, Shadow spotted Professor Oak with a watering can, giving water to a couple of plant Pok&#233;mon.</p>
<p class='Para'>"Professor Oak!" Shadow caught up to the Pok&#233;mon researcher. "I'm here, to receive, my new, Pok&#233;mon," he added, out of breath.</p>
<p class='Para'>"Oh, so you're the fourth Trainer to receive a new Pok&#233;mon today. Come on inside," Oak invited. Shadow followed him into a nicely decorated lobby, taking time to regain his composure as they walked. As they walked upstairs to presumably where Shadow would be receiving his new Pok&#233;mon, he blurted out, "I've thought about it a lot, and I've decided I'm going to choose Charmander!"</p>
<p class='Para'>"I'm afraid Charmander has already been chosen by a Trainer who wasn't late," Oak replied.</p>
<p class='Para'>Shadow was crestfallen for a few moments, but it faded quickly. "Then I'll pick Bulbasaur!" The image of the green, turtle-esque Pok&#233;mon filled his thoughts.</p>
<p class='Para'>"Bulbasaur was already chosen as well." </p>
<p class='Para'>"Alright. Then I'll go with Squirtle!"</p>
<p class='Para'>"Being just a second late for something, even a training, can be life-changing," Oak said as they got to the top of the staircase. Shadow saw a different Trainer the same age as him picking up a Pok&#233;ball from one of three cushions that lay on the floor and quietly shouting in joy as he headed down the same staircase. </p>
<p class='Para'>Shadow looked back at the cushions. All three were empty, small indents in the fabric the only remnant of Pok&#233;balls being there. "W-what do I do now?" he uncertainly asked, stepping forward and looking around. "Will I have to start my journey without a Pok&#233;mon?"</p>
<p class='Para'>"Not necessarily. There is one more Pok&#233;mon," Oak began. Shadow looked at a catwalk of a third floor and saw a small, blue tail with a kink at the end sticking out. "Is that it?" he queried, his heart beginning to pound.</p>
<p class='Para'>"Yes, but-" Oak was cut off as Shadow ran up the stairs quickly. To his right was a small Pok&#233;mon about half as big as him. "Are you my new Pok&#233;mon partner?" he excitedly asked it.</p>
<p class='Para'>But it had a different plan, jumping on top of the railing and down to the floor below. Shadow ran after it down the stairs, but he tripped and fell again, landing flat on his face at the base. When he recollected his thoughts, he saw the creature hiding behind Oak's legs, quietly laughing at him.</p>
<p class='Para'>"-it has a bit of a problem."</p>
<p class='Para'>Shadow got up and saw the Pok&#233;mon clearly. It was mostly blue and black, featuring a kinked tail and two small, white bumps on its thin arms. Around its mischievous red eyes was what appeared to be a black bandit mask. On either side of the mask lay an ovular appendage of the same color.</p>
<p class='Para'>"This is Riolu, the Emanation Pok&#233;mon." Oak introduced Shadow's partner as it stepped out of hiding.</p>
<p class='Para'>"Riolu, huh?" Shadow echoed. He walked over to it and kneeled down gently to pick it up, but as he brought it to face height it did not look amused. In his peripherals, he saw the professor back away a few steps as Riolu raised one of its tiny paws and planted it on his forehead. A brilliant white light appeared from it, and Shadow had no time to react before he became the victim of an explosion. Pain flooded him, and as the black smoke cleared he saw Riolu climb out of his grasp and back onto the ground, but he shook it away, undeterred. Riolu was not going to win this.</p>
<p class='Para'>"Here's its Pok&#233;ball," Oak said, handing Shadow a round device much like the one in his dream. Although, this one featured a small, teal-colored circle above its central button. "That emblem is that of an Aura Sphere. Riolu, as well as Riolu's evolution, Lucario, are able to manipulate a force called Aura. I'm sure you'll find it fascinating."</p>
<p class='Para'>Shadow heard footsteps come up from behind him, and he turned to see his father finally catching up to him, a bunch of supplies in his arms. Shadow recognized his normal clothes&mdash;looking down, he quickly became hot with embarrassment as he realized he was still in his pajamas&mdash;as well as a backpack.</p>
<p class='Para'>"I figured you would need this stuff," his father sardonically said as Shadow quickly took his clothes and slid them over his pajamas. He took his backpack and casually slung it over his shoulder.</p>
<p class='Para'>"Alright, Riolu!" Shadow livelily exclaimed now that his gear was in order. But Riolu stayed put and looked the other way as if it wanted nothing to do with him.</p>
<p class='Para'>Shadow's father leaned into his son's ear. "Aren't Pok&#233;mon supposed to go in their Pok&#233;balls?" he quizzed.</p>
<p class='Para'>"Oh, right! Okay, Riolu, get inside!" Shadow tossed its Pok&#233;ball toward it, hoping it would enter. Riolu, on the other hand, opened its eyes wide and turned and smacked the device with its tail, landing it right back in Shadow's hand.</p>
<p class='Para'>"You see, this Riolu hates getting into any sort of Pok&#233;ball," Oak explained.</p>
<p class='Para'>Shadow growled, determined not to let Riolu get the better of him. He threw the Pok&#233;ball harder at his partner, who expectedly batted back it back at him. He threw it again, and again, and again, and again until Riolu got fed up with the game and smacked it straight into his face. As he pulled it out of its position, he heard Riolu laugh again.</p>
<p class='Para'>"I suppose if you're playing catch, you're good friends already," Shadow's father pointed out.</p>
<p class='Para'>"Yeah, you're right! Come on, Riolu!" Shadow picked up the troublesome thing for the second time and smiled at it, hoping to gain its friendship. But, to his dismay, it raised its paw again. Closing his eyes, he felt another jolt of pain as another explosion ensued that made him release his grip on Riolu and filled the entire room with smoke. As it cleared, Shadow saw the others' clothing blackened as well; they must have been too close.</p>
<p class='Para'>"Well, thank you, Professor Oak," Shadow said once they had all recovered. "Goodbye, dad."</p>
<p class='Para'>"Take care, Shadow," the two adults replied in unison.</p>
<p class='Para'>Riolu reluctantly trailed behind Shadow as he walked out of the building&mdash;the last obedient thing it would do for a while, he would later discover. "Well, Riolu, time to get going."</p>

<p align='justify'><i>&nbsp;</i></p>
<p align='justify'><i>&nbsp;</i></p>
<p align='justify'><i>&nbsp;</i></p>
<p align='justify'><i>&nbsp;</i></p>
<p class='Para'><i><b>"Is this going to last the </i></b>entire journey?" Shadow called behind him. Left with no other choice, he had tied a rope around Riolu's waste and dragged it along as he walked up a hill. "Is it because you don't like me?" he asked, perplexed. Riolu nodded behind him.</p>
<p class='Para'>Shadow stopped. "Well, I like you a lot!" He walked over to Riolu, who had an apathetic look plastered on its face, and undid the rope, putting it into his pocket. He extended a hand. "Come on, put her there." Riolu sharply turned its head away; a clear no. "You're a handful, aren't you?" Shadow murmured as he looked around for something interesting. There wasn't much, just a beaten dirt path amid some leafy trees and tall grass.</p>
<p class='Para'>Suddenly, the grass rustled. Looking closely, Shadow saw a circular clearing in the middle of it, with a tan bird in the middle pecking for grubs. "A Pidgey!" he whispered. He reached into his bag and pulled out a Pok&#233;ball that wasn't linked to a Pok&#233;mon. "Alright. Go Pok&#233;ball!" he shouted. The Pidgey's desert-colored feathers ruffled as it was struck by the device, and it disappeared in a flash of red. The Pok&#233;ball landed on the ground and began bobbing, its ordinarily white button flashing red. <i>Come on&hellip;</i></p>
<p class='Para'>A bright light came into existence, and Pidgey was back in the world just as quickly as it had gone inside. Other than a few misplaced feathers that it quickly smoothed out, it seemed as if it had never been put into a Pok&#233;ball.</p>
<p class='Para'>"Why didn't that work&hellip;" Shadow mused. "Oh, right, I have to battle it first! Okay, Riolu, let's battle that Pidgey!" Shadow pointed towards the bird, looking at Riolu, but not to his surprise, it clambered onto a nearby rock and sat down. <i>Would you like some popcorn?</i></p>
<p class='Para'>Shadow sighed.<i> </i>"If you want something done right, you gotta do it yourself!" He noticed a large-sized stone on the ground that fit in his palm nicely. <i>Just have to line up the shot&hellip;</i> The Pidgey suddenly took flight, and Shadow threw the rock. It just barely missed its target and landed in the grass. "Darn."</p>
<p class='Para'>As Shadow turned around, the grass rustled again. Snapping his head back to where the rock landed, he saw a different bird Pok&#233;mon, a Spearow, raise its head. On top of its head was a large bump; he must have accidentally hit it. </p>
<p class='Para'>Beside him, Riolu laughed; admittedly, it did look a little funny. But as Shadow watched the Spearow's eyes, he saw that it made a connection. It flapped its feathery wings and dove straight toward Riolu; it must have thought that it threw the rock! Riolu stopped laughing and, actually serious this time, struck the Spearow with a Force Palm that sent it twirling back into the air. It fled to a nearby oak tree.</p>
<p class='Para'>Everything became quiet, but the air was still static with tension. The tree rustled, and what must have been a thousand Spearow poured out, all flying towards the two of them. "Riolu, we need to go!" Shadow and his partner began sprinting the other direction, but the birds caught up to them with ease. They swarmed around Riolu, leaving Shadow at the outside of the sphere of feathers.</p>
<p class='Para'>"No! I'm the one who threw the rock; you should be attacking me!" Shadow pushed some of the spectating birds out of the way to the center. Nudging aside the assailants, he picked up a heavily scratched Riolu and began running, the Spearow switching targets and pecking at his clothing. In his arms, Riolu's eyes were tiny slits. "It's OK, you're gonna be fine!"</p>
<p class='Para'>Looking behind him, Shadow saw the swarm of Spearow gaining ground, and began running harder. But when he looked forward, he saw the one thing he didn't need: a cliff. He didn't have time to stop before he and Riolu plunged over the side. Shadow tightened his grip on his friend as the two of them smacked into the icy water.</p>
<p class='Para'><i>Gotta swim up! </i>Shadow's head breached the surface of the water as he thrust his legs down and spotted a flat patch of land a few paces away that was bordered by a small copse of evergreen trees. He swam over to it and laid Riolu down; it coughed up water, but it was still breathing. Overhead, dark, ominous clouds had gathered and blanketed the entire sky.</p>
<p class='Para'>"Are you okay, Riolu?" There was no response, and no time to check further. Shadow heard the cacophonous calls of more Spearow and turned to see them streaming out from the ridge, as vindictive as ever.</p>
<p class='Para'>Adrenaline the only thing left for him to use, Shadow hoisted Riolu into his arms and emerged through the other side of the brush into a flat, grassy plain. "Hang on, you're gonna be alright!" he told Riolu, unsure if it heard him. A single raindrop fell beneath its eye and trickled down before the rest of the storm broke, immediately drenching the two.</p>
<p class='Para'>Beside them, the Spearow swarm caught up. Individual birds began flying alongside Shadow, and before long he felt sharp beaks penetrating his clothes. <i>Just a little farther, there has to be a town nearby! </i>A Spearow knocked into Shadow's leg and he skidded in the newly-formed mud, tumbling over a ledge. He let go of Riolu and fell to the ground, his partner feet away from him and barely awake.</p>
<p class='Para'>"This can't be happening, can it?" Shadow pleaded, in disbelief that such a fate would befall him on day one. He reached into his pocket and pulled out Riolu's Pok&#233;ball, the sphere of Aura emblazoned on it. "Riolu, I know you hate being in your Pok&#233;ball, but you have to get inside; you'll be safe in there." Without waiting for an answer, he rolled it to his partner.</p>
<p class='Para'>With what little strength he had left, he stood up, plastered in mud. Behind him, Riolu stared, wide-eyed. "Alright, you! I don't think you know who you're dealing with, but I'm Shadow from Pallet Town, and I'm gonna be the world greatest Pok&#233;mon Master! Mess with me and you're gonna lose!</p>
<p class='Para'>"I'm gonna catch all of you at once!" he added. The Spearow, who had been flying uncoordinatedly, began to bunch up as if preparing a final strike.</p>
<p class='Para'>"Riolu, get inside, please," Shadow said behind him. Raising his voice to the Spearow, he taunted, "Hit me with your best shot!"</p>
<p class='Para'>Time seemed to slow down as the flock converged on Shadow. Lightning struck, illuminating the entire area in a brilliant blue. Shadow felt something pull on his legs, and then his torso, and then his shoulders, and looked in awe as Riolu jumped from him as if it wasn't even injured. He squinted as a teal sphere began to form from his partner's paws, and suddenly a dazzling light the same color as the lightning engulfed the entire area.</p>
<p class='Para'>Shadow felt himself get knocked off of his legs, and he fell back down. But when the light subsided, the Spearow were flying away, never to be seen again. The clouds began to clear, revealing a beautiful orange sunset that bathed Shadow in a homely hue.</p>
<p class='Para'>A small noise made him look to his right. Riolu lay beside him, its eyes full of emotion. Shadow brought it close to him, and a pink tongue licked his cheek.</p>
<p class='Para'>"You'll stay? You mean it?" he asked. Riolu nodded, and Shadow buried it in his arms for a long time.</p>
<p class='Para'>A grand cry interrupted them. Shadow rose to his legs, Riolu taking a position on his shoulder, and stared in amazement at a rainbow-colored bird Pok&#233;mon flying through the sky that seemed to embody everything good in the world. He followed its path to a brand new rainbow, but a tinkling sound distracted him. Above him, a small object floated down, and he caught it in his hands. It was like a feather, but shiny and rainbow-colored. He put it in his pocket. "Riolu, someday we're gonna both meet that Pok&#233;mon."</p>

<p align='justify'><i>&nbsp;</i></p>
<p class='Para'><i><b>"Let's go, Riolu!"</i></b></p>
<p class='Para'><i><b>Lights glared in</i></b> Shadow's eyes as he stared down the dirt battlefield and locked eyes with his opponent Erika, the leader of the Celadon Gym. Clad in a vibrant orange kimono, she stood confidently on the other edge of her turf. "Go, Tangela!" she announced serenely, elegantly tossing a Pok&#233;ball onto her side of the field. What appeared to be a mess of blue vines with stubby, red feet and no arms appeared to face Shadow's partner.</p>
<p class='Para'>Since Shadow and Riolu's fateful first day, they had acquired two Gym Badges&mdash;tokens proving a Trainer's victory at a Gym that were also the ticket to entering the Pok&#233;mon League&mdash;and after this battle, Shadow was sure they would have three. Ever since day one, Riolu had begun warming up to Shadow, and now the two felt unstoppable together. </p>
<p class='Para'>On the side of the field, a referee explained the rules, "This battle will be a one on one. When either side's Pok&#233;mon becomes unable to battle, the other side will be declared the winner. Ready?" When both Trainers nodded, he threw up his hand. "Begin!"</p>
<p class='Para'>"I'll let you have the first move." Erika bowed.</p>
<p class='Para'>Shadow took it as a challenge. "You're on! Riolu, use Aura Sphere!" Shadow's partner put its paws together in front of its face, and a teal blue sphere began forming. With a shout, Riolu sent it across the field and it homed in on Tangela.</p>
<p class='Para'>"Tangela, dodge!" Erika cried to her Pok&#233;mon. But even as Tangela jumped to the side, the Aura Sphere switched directions and hit it dead-on, forming a small cloud of smoke and knocking it back a few paces.</p>
<p class='Para'>"That's the beauty of Aura Sphere; it never misses," Shadow called. "Riolu, let's keep the pressure on with Quick Attack!" Trails of thin light were left in Riolu's wake as it closed the distance between it and Tangela in the blink of an eye. </p>
<p class='Para'>"Use Vine Whip!" Blue tendrils emerged from Tangela's body and ensnared Riolu before it was able to strike, leaving it defenseless against an onslaught of slaps.</p>
<p class='Para'>Shadow tensed. "Use, er, Force Palm! Yeah, use it on the vines and get away!" He breathed a sigh of relief as a white explosion allowed Riolu to hop back. As he paused, he looked at his partner, covered in scratches. The Vine Whip had done a lot of damage. <i>I'm gonna have to wrap this battle up fast. And I know just how.</i></p>
<p class='Para'>"I started the battle with it, and I'll end the battle with it! Riolu, use Aura Sphere and knock it out of the park!" An even bigger orb was launched towards Tangela.</p>
<p class='Para'>"Tangela, defend with Vine Whip!" Tangela raised its vines to block the oncoming attack. When the two collided, a large, dark plume of smoke engulfed the area where Tangela was. Suddenly, a projectile left the cloud at blurring speed. It zoomed past Erika and collided with a rock in the background. It was Tangela, with swirls on its eyes; telltale signs of being fainted and unable to continue.</p>
<p class='Para'>Erika bowed. "Very well," she conceded, walking toward Shadow, who was busy trying to keep his composure. When she was standing in front of him she revealed a wooden box with a cushion on top. A metal trinket was sat on top of the cushion "You have defeated me. As proof of your victory at the Celadon Gym, take the Rainbow Badge."</p>
<p class='Para'>Shadow shakily took the badge and studied it. It resembled a flower, with a silver middle and eight petals, each colored a different color of the rainbow.</p>
<p class='Para'>"YES!" he shouted into the heavens, holding the symbol up. "I got the Rainbow Badge!"</p>
<p class='Para'>Riolu echoed Shadow's excitement and ran over. Shadow extended his arms to hug it, but all of a sudden, it started glowing blue, white particles swirling around it. As it ran, its body seemed to morph, becoming taller than before, and when it was complete, color returned to its body in an instant. It had evolved.</p>
<p class='Para'>"Lucario!" Shadow hugged his newly-changed partner tightly before getting a closer look at it. It had most of the same features Riolu had, but the previous bumps on its arms were now spikes. Its chest had developed tan fur, and a third spike jutted out of the center of it. Its ears had grown to be sharper, sporting a black inside, and there were four appendages on the back of its head instead of two.</p>
<p class='Para'>"Congratulations, Shadow," Erika said happily.</p>
<p class='Para'>"Thank you!" the Trainer returned before he and Lucario said their goodbyes and walked out of the gym. </p>
<p class='Para'>"I'm so happy that you evolved, Lucario!" Shadow repeated as the two of them stood outside. He might sound like a broken record, but he was too ecstatic to care.</p>
<p class='Para'>"Carr!" Lucario happily shouted back at him.</p>
<p class='Para'>Shadow chuckled. "Come on, let's head out into the forest," he invited, stepping off towards a path that led to a borderline of trees. Lucario followed close behind, and they both breathed in the fresh air as they walked through the trees.</p>
<p class='Para'>"I still wonder what Pok&#233;mon that was," Shadow mused as he pulled the rainbow-colored wing from his jacket pocket. "It had to have been an important Pok&#233;mon; after all, iridescent feathers don't just fall from the sky every day," he added humorously.</p>
<p class='Para'>Lucario's shout pulled Shadow away from his thoughts. Returning to reality, he saw his friend pointing in the trees at a green caterpillar-like creature that he registered as a Caterpie. Judging by the fact that it was staring them both down, it looked ready to attack.</p>
<p class='Para'>"Alright, Caterpie!" Shadow yelled. "If it's a fight you want, it's a fight you'll get!" Lowering his voice, he added, "This'll be your first battle as a Lucario. Let's make it good! Use&hellip;er, what moves do you know now?" It was common knowledge that as a Pok&#233;mon grew, it learned new attacks, but Shadow wasn't sure what his partner was capable of. At least Professor Oak had told him what moves it knew as a Riolu.</p>
<p class='Para'>Lucario planted a paw on its face. Then it stood in front of its Trainer and began charging a teal sphere. "Oh, that's Aura Sphere," Shadow noticed. Nodding, Lucario moved to explode the air in what Shadow knew as Force Palm. "So you still know those two." Then Lucario put both of its paws together in front of itself and grew a white outline before dashing at breakneck speed around Shadow. "That looked like Quick Attack." When Lucario shook its head, Shadow consulted a book he had found at a library that helpfully explained most moves. After some fumbling, he found the one: Extreme Speed. "So a step up from Quick Attack," he murmured. Lastly, Lucario put its paws side-by-side above its head and separated them, revealing a teal, bone-like object that it swung around nimbly before dissipating it into thin air. "Bone Rush," Shadow quoted his manual, "and you made it out of Aura, too. That's awesome!</p>
<p class='Para'>"Well, now that we know what you can do, let's do this, Lucario! Use Bone Rush and knock Caterpie out of that tree!" Lucario happily obliged, instantiating another bone and whacking the limb that the caterpillar was on.</p>
<p class='Para'>But Caterpie opened its mouth mid-air and spat a string of web at the limb, clearly not ready to lose. With the momentum, it headbutted Lucario square in the chest, sending it stumbling backward.</p>
<p class='Para'>Shadow gasped. "Of course&hellip;you haven't healed yet, which means we're at a disadvantage." He reached into his pocket. "Which also means we need to end this battle." Pulling out an empty Pok&#233;ball, he yelled "Go Pok&#233;ball!" and threw it at the Caterpie. <i>You're not escaping it this time!</i></p>
<p class='Para'>For what seemed like ages the Pok&#233;ball wobbled, Shadow and Lucario in silence. </p>
<p class='Para'>But then the button turned red and a <i>ding </i>sounded, meaning that it was successful.</p>
<p class='Para'>"Alright, I got Caterpie!" Shadow said aloud, confidently picking up the Pok&#233;ball. He threw it back to the ground, and the bug Pok&#233;mon appeared, tamed. "I'm glad to have you, Caterpie," Shadow said warmly. Lucario gave a similar cry.</p>
<p class='Para'>"I think that's enough walking for now," Shadow said aloud. Peering through the trees, he noticed a tent-shaped Pok&#233;mon Center. "Let's go over there," he suggested, pointing to it. After a few steps, he heard a whining sound behind him and turned to see Caterpie with a confused expression. "Oh, that's right. I should put you back into your Pok&#233;ball," he realized. He popped the device from his belt and touched Caterpie with it; the caterpillar morphed into a red blob and disappeared inside.</p>
<p class='Para'>Once Shadow and Lucario made it inside, Shadow took in his surroundings; despite being in the middle of a forest, the place seemed like a hotspot, with quite a few trainers all around. Nonetheless, he went straight to a nearby video telephone booth. <i>About time I did this,</i> he thought as he dialed a number. In his peripherals, he saw Lucario playing with a Bulbasaur that had just walked in with its Trainer.</p>
<p class='Para'>"Hello?" a familiar voice sounded, and when the screen updated, Shadow's eyes lit up.</p>
<p class='Para'>"Hi, dad!" he whispered.</p>
<p class='Para'>"Hey, Shadow!" his father replied. But the shine in his eyes quickly turned into annoyance. "Where have you been? It took you this long to call?"</p>
<p class='Para'>"Wha? If that's all you're concerned about, I'm hanging up," melancholily responded.</p>
<p class='Para'>"Now just you wait, young man! You've been away for so long! How are you? Are you eating right? How are your Pok&#233;mon? Have you gotten any Gym Badges?"</p>
<p class='Para'>In the distance, Shadow thought he heard someone snicker. He took a deep breath, trying not to blow up in public. "I've been all over Kanto; I didn't think to do so until now; I'm doing well; yes; Lucario is fine; I have 3 badges," he said before gasping for air.</p>
<p class='Para'>Shadow heard movement next to him and turned to see Lucario shuffling into the camera. Once it came into view, Shadow's dad exclaimed, "That can't be Riolu, can it? It looks so different!"</p>
<p class='Para'>"Nope, that's Lucario," Shadow confirmed. "It evolved!"</p>
<p class='Para'>"No way!" Judging from his father's expression, Shadow thought it was clear he didn't really know much about Pok&#233;mon.</p>
<p class='Para'>A sound from behind Shadow interrupted the conversation, and he looked behind him to see a Trainer with a blue, aquatic Pok&#233;mon recognizable as a Vaporeon rushing to the front desk. "Nurse Joy, you gotta help me!" he pleaded, showing the battered animal to her.</p>
<p class='Para'>The nurse examined it. "That doesn't look good. What happened?"</p>
<p class='Para'>"We tried to battle Entei in the forest," he explained.</p>
<p class='Para'>"Huh?" Shadow said aloud before his father began yelling at him again. "S-sorry dad, I gotta go," he said before switching it off, not caring what he was saying. "Come on, Lucario," he motioned, joining the growing crowd around the new Trainer. "Did you say Entei?" he asked him.</p>
<p class='Para'>"Yeah." The Trainer's eyes were wide. "We were looking for it because it was Legendary and thus super rare and all, so when we found it we tried to catch it. But it beat us in no time flat and ran back into the forest."</p>
<p class='Para'>"So it's still out there," Shadow mused to himself. "Let's go, Lucario!" he called to his partner, running outside like the rest of the gathered group. "Now where could Entei be?" he thought aloud once the adrenaline had worn off. "This forest is way too dense."</p>
<p class='Para'>Shadow felt a tap on his shoulder and turned to see Lucario staring at him with a smirk on its face. It closed its eyes and extended a paw in front of it, and its appendages started levitating to become flush with the back of its head. After a few seconds, it opened its eyes and pointed to a spot in the distance, where Shadow could barely make out a tiny mouse Pok&#233;mon scurry along.</p>
<p class='Para'>"That's right," Shadow said in awe, "you work with Aura. And since every living being has an Aura, you can sense them, can't you?" Lucario nodded in affirmation, and a smile crept onto Shadow's face. "Then let's find Entei!"</p>
<p class='Para'>Lucario walked in front of Shadow and put up its paw before slowly walking forward, Shadow following suit. Despite the flood of Trainers into the forest, the thickness of the giant trees around them drowned out any noise they could have made, leaving Shadow to listen to the crunch of the leaves on the ground As they walked and the distant chirping of bird Pok&#233;mon in the leafy canopy.</p>
<p class='Para'>But it wasn't long before Lucario quietly shouted, drawing Shadow's attention away from the scenery. Looking through a pair of trees in front of them, Shadow eyed a clearing in the giant forest with a large rock. On top of that rock was a giant, brown-colored quadruped that he knew only as Entei.</p>
<p class='Para'>"There it is!" Shadow shouted, but he stopped himself. The voice had sounded different. Turning to his right, he saw that another Trainer, clad in a blue hoodie, had said the exact same thing at the exact same time. Without waiting, she yelled, "Piplup, let's go!" and threw a Pok&#233;ball in the air while bolting towards the clearing, a teal blue penguin appearing on her shoulder. Shadow and Lucario ran after her. "I saw Entei first!" the former shouted towards the newcomer.</p>
<p class='Para'>"No, I did!" came the response a little ahead.</p>
<p class='Para'>"No, <i>I</i> did!" Shadow returned.</p>
<p class='Para'>Shadow had just caught up to her when a large rock appeared in his path. Having to run over it, he fell behind, and the new Trainer was the first to enter the clearing. "Piplup, use Bubble Beam!" Shadow her shout before bursting into the clearing himself, Lucario right behind him.</p>
<p class='Para'>The blue penguin spat a stream of small spheres towards the giant beast on the rock, but Entei gracefully bounded out of the way, landing a few feet from Shadow. Looking up at it, Shadow suddenly couldn't move, instead finding himself staring at Entei's red eyes.</p>
<p class='Para'>"Get outta there!" the other Trainer shouted, and Shadow's wits returned just in time to roll away and avoid a burst of flames. "Lucario, use Aura Sphere!" he shouted, and his Pok&#233;mon partner fired at Entei. But despite being a direct hit, the Legendary Pok&#233;mon seemed unfazed, jumping across the clearing again and landing next to the other Trainer, who fell over, and then returning to the mound of rock. </p>
<p class='Para'>Shadow and Lucario ran towards Entei along with the new Trainer and her Piplup, determined to catch it. But another stream of fire forced them all to jump to the side. Shadow tripped on a stone, but thankfully he wasn't roasted until he felt a burning sensation and saw that his pants were on fire. Rolling across on the ground, he put them out before he was hurt.</p>
<p class='Para'>"<i>My</i> Lucario, use Aura Sphere!" Shadow looked up to see a third Trainer had entered the clearing with a Lucario of his own that tossed another sphere at Entei. But just like with Shadow's Lucario, the attack did next to nothing, and Entei returned the attack with a Flamethrower that hit its opponent straight on, knocking it against a tree. Its Trainer knelt next to it to help it, but the battle was not finished yet.</p>
<p class='Para'>"Piplup, use Bubble Beam again!" Shadow heard the female Trainer command. The barrage of bubbles missed entirely as Entei leaped into the air, nearly blotting out the sun, and slammed back down onto the ground with a force so tremendous it bowled both remaining Trainers over. Standing up as fast as he could, Shadow was dismayed to see that Entei was already bounding away, not to be seen again.</p>
<p class='Para'>"You let it escape!" Shadow's respite was interrupted by the Trainer next to him railing on him.</p>
<p class='Para'>"I easily could have caught it if you hadn't been in the way!" he retorted, hoping he sounded more confident about it than he was.</p>
<p class='Para'>"No, you were in the way!"</p>
<p class='Para'>"No, <i>you</i> were!"</p>
<p class='Para'>"Fine, then. Let's settle it with a Pok&#233;mon battle!" the Trainer said, stepping backward to make room.</p>
<p class='Para'>"You're on!" Shadow returned, eager to defeat this hotheaded rival. "I'm Shadow, from Pallet Town!"</p>
<p class='Para'>"And I'm Verity from Twinleaf Town!"</p>
<p class='Para'><i>Twinleaf Town? </i>Shadow echoed internally. <i>Isn't that a town in Sinnoh, way away from here?</i></p>
<p class='Para'>"Hey, new guy," Verity continued, turning over to the new Trainer who was helping his Lucario up. "Once I polish off this kid, you're next!"</p>
<p class='Para'>"I wanna battle you too!" Shadow echoed before his mind caught up. "Hey!" he said disapprovingly at Verity, who turned away and chortled.</p>
<p class='Para'>"I'm Sorrel," the Trainer responded after making sure his Pok&#233;mon was healthy. "I'm going to pass on the battles."</p>
<p class='Para'>"Why?" Shadow and Verity said in unison.</p>
<p class='Para'>"I would find shelter if I were you," Sorrel continued as if he didn't hear them. "It's going to rain soon."</p>
<p class='Para'>"Rain soon?" Verity repeated.</p>
<p class='Para'>"But there's not a cloud in the sky," Shadow added. But Sorrel and his Lucario were already walking back the way they had come.</p>
<p class='Para'>"Scared of a little rain?" Verity taunted. "Do you need to call your mommy?"</p>
<p class='Para'>"Hey! Let's just get this battle underway," Shadow defended, feeling that the joke had gone a little too far.</p>
<p class='Para'>"Piplup, let's go!" Verity announced, her tiny penguin dashing forward.</p>
<p class='Para'>"Lucario, let's do this!" Shadow shouted, his spirit renewed. "I'll let you have the first move," he added, giving a comically large bow.</p>
<p class='Para'>"Don't be a gentleman. You might regret it," Verity countered. "Piplup, use Drill Peck!" The penguin's beak suddenly turned white, and, much like a drill, it started speeding through the air, spinning rapidly. </p>
<p class='Para'>"Lucario, counter with Bone Rush!" Lucario conjured another teal bone and swung it like a bat at Piplup, but Piplup simply bounced off of the Bone Rush; the two moves must have been similar in power. "Now use Extreme Speed!" In a flash of speed, Lucario slammed into Piplup, sending the latter tumbling across the grass.</p>
<p class='Para'>"We're not finished yet!" Verity affirmed. "Piplup, use Hydro Pump!" A seemingly impossible amount of water started blasting from Piplup's mouth, aimed right for its opponent.</p>
<p class='Para'>"Dodge!" Shadow shouted, and luckily Lucario leaped to the side, and the stream of water hit a bunch of rocks outside the clearing.</p>
<p class='Para'>"Nice job, Lucario. Now use-"</p>
<p class='Para'>Shadow was interrupted by a rumbling sound. Turning behind him, he saw that the mound of rocks was moving. It started rising into the air until it stood at least 21 feet tall. "That's-"</p>
<p class='Para'>"An Onix!" Verity finished.</p>
<p class='Para'>"Run!" Shadow shouted, turning around. In front of him, Verity and Lucario were already fleeing, but Piplup's legs were too small to effectively run fast. In a burst of adrenaline, Shadow jumped for it and picked it up before catching up to the others. "Here," he said breathlessly to Verity as he handed her her Pok&#233;mon.</p>
<p class='Para'>"Thanks." Up ahead, the trees began to thin, and a rock gorge presented itself. "Down here," Verity said, sliding down the rock face. Shadow and Lucario joined her, and luckily it was smooth enough for them not to get hurt. But as they turned left, a loud crash was heard, and looking back, Shadow saw that Onix had dug straight through the wall of the forge.</p>
<p class='Para'>"This way!" he yelled, taking the lead while running down the center. A large rock was in the center, and he added, "If we get on top of there we'll be out of Onix's path."</p>
<p class='Para'>"Good idea." The three of them ran to the top, hoping Onix would give up. But it kept chasing and burst right through the rock, shattering it into pieces as the three of them fell onto Onix's back and began holding on to the jagged stones for dear life. Clearly enraged, Onix turned into a wild horse and began slamming into the walls and pushing through rocks as it barreled down the gorge.</p>
<p class='Para'>"Stop it, Onix!" Shadow shouted as it broke another boulder. "You're gonna hurt yourself!"</p>
<p class='Para'>"Yelling at it will only make it angrier!" Verity shouted at him.</p>
<p class='Para'>"Then I guess I'll have to try something else!" Shadow inched his way up the giant rock snake until he reached his head. <i>Here goes!</i> He pushed off of Onix with all of the strength in his legs and propelled himself forward before sliding on the rock. Turning around, he began frantically waving his arms, trying to get the enraged Pok&#233;mon to slow down. </p>
<p class='Para'>But Onix had no intention of doing so, and as it began closing distance fast, Shadow started to doubt himself. Suddenly a large, swirling mass of water appeared in front of Onix's face, and it finally stopped. Looking beyond it, Shadow saw tiny Piplup standing up, its beak wide open. Realizing that this was finally his chance, he said, "Onix, I'm sorry we startled you. Please, calm down."</p>
<p class='Para'>For a moment, nothing happened, the swirl of Piplup's Whirlpool the only thing being heard. But after Shadow was certain his heart had stopped beating, Onyx lowered its head, allowing Verity and Piplup to slide down, and burrowed into the floor, leaving a gaping hole.</p>
<p class='Para'>"I'm sorry, Onix!" Verity called after it, her words echoing.</p>
<p class='Para'>"Piplup really saved the day with that Whirlpool," Shadow commented after a few deep breaths.</p>
<p class='Para'>"You're the one who stopped Onyx," Verity returned. "You know, you do dumb things, but I'm impressed."</p>
<p class='Para'>Shadow was about to retort when a drop of water landed on his neck. Looking up, clouds had somehow gathered and were starting to pour.</p>
<p class='Para'>"Rain!" Verity exclaimed. "Just like that Sorrel guy said."</p>
<p class='Para'>"Come on, let's find some shelter," Shadow called to Verity and Lucario, climbing up a less steep part of the rock face. Once they all reached the top, Shadow led his companions into the forest, thankful that the canopy was thick enough to partially shelter them from the rain.</p>
<p class='Para'>"You'd think a Pok&#233;mon Center would be nearby," Verity murmured as the rain became harsher and harsher. Up ahead, a small clearing opened up, allowing Shadow to see the dark grey storm above with seemingly no end.</p>
<p class='Para'>"Char."</p>
<p class='Para'>Shadow's head snapped to a tiny, orange lizard-like Pok&#233;mon sitting on a tiny rock, exposed to the elements. On its tail, a small flame burned weakly, but it made no attempt to shelter it, instead melancholily looking at the ground.</p>
<p class='Para'>"That's a Charmander," Verity pointed out. "What's it doing in the rain?"</p>
<p class='Para'>"It doesn't look too healthy," Shadow added. But the Charmander suddenly looked up, its face brightening, and started running off to the other side of the clearing. Looking past it, Shadow made out a Trainer with bright orange hair standing in the middle of the path, a red, werewolf-looking creature with glowing eyes that Shadow recognized as a Midnight-form Lycanroc next to him. Charmander hugged the Trainer's leg, and Shadow was relieved; it found its Trainer!</p>
<p class='Para'>But instead of acting worried for the Charmander, the Trainer took one look at the small salamander and kicked it into the mud. "You're still here? Go away."</p>
<p class='Para'>"Hey!" Shadow shouted, running forward to pick up the fallen lizard.</p>
<p class='Para'>"Are you its Trainer?" Verity asked.</p>
<p class='Para'>"Was," he apathetically returned. "I ditched the weakling; there are Charmander like that all over the place. But it kept following me, so I told it to wait in the rain."</p>
<p class='Para'>Shadow's blood began to boil. "That's an awful thing to say!"</p>
<p class='Para'>"That's so irresponsible!" Verity added. "Some Pok&#233;mon would actually wait forever!"</p>
<p class='Para'>"What's the problem?" came the sly response.</p>
<p class='Para'>Without thinking, Shadow lunged forward, intending to teach this hoodlum a lesson. He locked arms with him, but his opponent was stronger than he thought; he knocked Shadow back and his Lycanroc headbutted him onto the ground next to Verity.</p>
<p class='Para'>"Only a Pok&#233;mon's strength matters," the Trainer continued as if the fight didn't even phase him. "If it's going to survive, it had better grow stronger."</p>
<p class='Para'>"It's Trainer's job to help their Pok&#233;mon grow strong!" Verity retorted.</p>
<p class='Para'>Cross grunted. "What do you get out of that anyway?"</p>
<p class='Para'>"You get to become friends," Shadow replied, getting up.</p>
<p class='Para'>"You're too soft. The only thing friendship does is make a Pok&#233;mon weak. I'm Cross, and I'm going to become the greatest Trainer ever," Cross finished, walking away with his Lycanroc.</p>
<p class='Para'>Charmander leaped out of Verity's arms and attempted to run after its former Trainer, but it fell over in the mud, weakly trying to crawl.</p>
<p class='Para'>"Its flame is getting weaker," Verity pointed out; in fact, it was barely the size of Shadow's palm. "And if it were to go out&hellip;"</p>
<p class='Para'>Shadow walked over to Charmander, picking it up and holding his jacket over it. "That's not gonna happen. Come on, we need to find shelter right away."</p>
<p class='Para'>"Over there!" Verity pointed out. "Through the trees, I think I see a cave."</p>
<p class='Para'>The two of them wordlessly ran towards the large mountain until the forest abruptly stopped a few yards away. Wordlessly entering the expansive mouth, Shadow saw a faint, orange light coming from within. Looking closer, he saw that someone else was here and that they had a fire lit on an upper plateau of the cave.</p>
<p class='Para'>The human next to the fire stood up as he saw the arrivals, and in the firelight, Shadow was sure it was Sorrel. Next to him was his Lucario; it must be.</p>
<p class='Para'>Sorrel skidded down the face of the ledge and ran to Shadow, who was gingerly holding Charmander. "You left it in the rain! What were you thinking?" he shouted in his face.</p>
<p class='Para'>"Calm down," Verity responded, "it's not his fault. It was in the rain after its Trainer abandoned it. It would have stayed out there forever."</p>
<p class='Para'>Sorrel's face shifted from anger to realization before hardening again. "Come on, let's head to the fire." The four of them climbed up the slope to the fire, where Sorrel had supplies laid out across the floor. As Shadow walked to put Charmander on a cloth next to the fire, he looked up at Sorrel's Lucario and caught it staring at his own, recognition flashing in its eyes.</p>
<p class='Para'>As Shadow and Verity took off their jackets and hung them to dry, Sorrel began rummaging through a bag of berries and ingredients Shadow did not recognize. Putting them all into a mortar and pestle and adding some water, he ground them into a green liquid. "I know it's bitter," he reassured as he took a spoonful of the mixture and fed it to Charmander, who was barely conscious. It swallowed, its face screwing up a small bit before relaxing. "That should stabilize you. Now all you need is rest." Putting his tools away, he muttered, "It shouldn't get cold."</p>
<p class='Para'>"I'll hold it," Shadow volunteered, lightly taking the small lizard and cradling it in his lap. He walked to the wall opposite Sorrel and sat down, Lucario joining him. Verity sat down on the wall between them.</p>
<p class='Para'>Suddenly, Charmander stirred in Shadow's arms. "How are you feeling?" Shadow asked it, Lucario grunting a similar tone. A drowsy "Charmander" was the response before it was asleep as soon as it had awoken.</p>
<p class='Para'>Shadow didn't notice Sorrel standing next to him. "It's looking a lot better," he said cheerfully as he examined the lizard.</p>
<p class='Para'>"Thank you for helping it," Shadow said.</p>
<p class='Para'>"You're like Nurse Joy," Verity added across the cave.</p>
<p class='Para'>"I want to be a Pok&#233;mon professor," Sorrel explained as he sat down by his Pok&#233;mon, "and you need medical training for that. Right now, I'm studying Legendary Pok&#233;mon."</p>
<p class='Para'>"Then it was good that you ran into Entei, then," Verity commented.</p>
<p class='Para'>"Yep. So what are you doing here, Verity? You're a long way from home."</p>
<p class='Para'>"Well," she started, her expression changing to one of embarrassment, "it's a long story. What about you, Shadow?"</p>
<p class='Para'>"Who, me? I want to be the world's greatest Pok&#233;mon Master!" Shadow exclaimed.</p>
<p class='Para'>"Don't you mean the world's best Trainer?"</p>
<p class='Para'>"Nah, I want to be much more than that."</p>
<p class='Para'>A chilly draft blew in from the cave opening. "It's going to get cold tonight," Verity murmured worriedly.</p>
<p class='Para'>Shadow suddenly sneezed, and his Lucario stood up from its dance around the fire with Piplup and sat next to Shadow. "Thanks," its Trainer said gratefully as Piplup did the same with Verity.</p>
<p class='Para'>"Well, you're going in your Pok&#233;ball," the more pragmatic Sorrel told his Pok&#233;mon.</p>
<p class='Para'>"You too," Verity echoed, doing the same with Piplup.</p>
<p class='Para'>"Well, I would like to do that," Shadow said as he looked at his Pok&#233;mon partner, "but Lucario hates being in its Pok&#233;ball."</p>
<p class='Para'>Two bright flashes appeared in the cave, and Piplup and Sorrel's Lucario were outside of their Pok&#233;balls, sitting right next to their Trainers.</p>
<p class='Para'>"You can't," Verity began.</p>
<p class='Para'>"You'll catch a cold," Sorrel ended.</p>
<p class='Para'>But Piplup crossed its arms in defiance, and Sorrel's Lucario shook its head. They wanted to stay outside.</p>
<p class='Para'>"The storm is getting worse," Shadow commented, peering past the wall to look at the cave mouth. Thunder resonated throughout the cave as a bright flash of lightning lit up the outdoors as it had been every few minutes for the past while. But through the heavy rain, Shadow thought he heard footsteps echoing from the entrance. Looking back at Sorrel and Verity, he found he wasn't imagining things; they were looking to the entrance as well.</p>
<p class='Para'>A very large Pok&#233;mon entered, silhouetted against the moonlit forest beyond. Around it were several tiny Pok&#233;mon. <i>Are we in a Pok&#233;mon's lair?</i> As the lighting shifted to be from the fire, Shadow could make out the Pok&#233;mon more clearly. The brown fur, the grey spikes on the back&mdash;it was Entei!</p>
<p class='Para'>An aura of silence enveloped the entire room as Entei climbed on top of a platform opposite the humans and laid down, the small Pok&#233;mon jumping around it before doing the same. Only the occasional thunder reminded Shadow that this was not a dream.</p>
<p class='Para'>"By seeing the fearful forces of nature, people and Pok&#233;mon are the same," Sorrel suddenly said. "About a hundred and fifty years ago, there was a Bell Tower, where people could make contact with Ho-Oh, the Rainbow Pok&#233;mon. However, lightning struck the tower, engulfing it in flames. A great rain came down and the flames were extinguished, but three nameless Pok&#233;mon perished in the fire.</p>
<p class='Para'>"But Ho-Oh descended, and gave life to them again! They represented the lightning that struck, the flames that engulfed, and the water that extinguished the tower. Raikou, Entei, and Suicune." He pulled out three cards from his backpack. One looked like Entei, but the other two Shadow did not recognize. "This is what they look like," Sorrel explained. He took out his electronic map and pulled up a fourth image. "And this is what Ho-Oh looks like."</p>
<p class='Para'>"I recognize that!" Shadow shouted once he saw Ho-Oh. He got up from the circle they had formed and ran to his jacket. "On day one of my journey, Ho-Oh flew over the sky, and it gave me this rainbow-colored wing." He took the item out of his pocket and showed it to everyone.</p>
<p class='Para'>"No way, you got the Rainbow Wing, let alone saw Ho-Oh?" Sorrel exclaimed, but Verity gave a perplexed shrug, asking, "What's a Rainbow Wing?" In the distance, Shadow made out Entei's glowing red eyes opening.</p>
<p class='Para'>"Few people have even seen Ho-Oh," Sorrel explained, "and on rare occasions, it will gift the Rainbow Wing to a Trainer it particularly likes.&#124;"</p>
<p class='Para'>"Then I guess Ho-Oh really likes me," Shadow concluded, putting the treasure back in his jacket pocket.</p>
<p class='Para'>"But why would it give you the Rainbow Wing?" Verity quizzed.</p>
<p class='Para'>Shadow was unsurprised that Sorrel held the answer. "There is a legend that tells of the existence of a Rainbow Hero who is guided by the Rainbow Wing to seek out Ho-Oh."</p>
<p class='Para'>"Well, I don't understand all of that, but I think that's really cool!" Shadow obliviously responded.</p>
<p class='Para'>"Oh, impressed with yourself, are you?" Verity said slyly.</p>
<p class='Para'>"Well, I suppose we should get some sleep," Sorrel concluded, getting up from his spot to sit next to his Lucario, Verity and Shadow copying him.</p>
<p class='Para'>"Goodnight," Verity said, yawning.</p>
<p class='Para'>"Goodnight," Shadow echoed.</p>

<p align='justify'><i>&nbsp;</i></p>
<p align='justify'><i>&nbsp;</i></p>
<p class='Para'><i><b>"Carr!"</i></b></p>
<p class='Para'><i><b>Shadow was abruptly awaken by </i></b>his partner shouting next to him. Blearily opening his eyes, he saw that the rain had stopped and thin shafts of sunlight were protruding through the top of the cave. Around him, Sorrel and Verity began waking up as well. "Morning, Piplup," the latter said cheerfully. "Sleep well?" Her partner responded with a bright "Piplup!"</p>
<p class='Para'>Lucario stood up and walked around before gasping. Following its gaze to the plateau where Entei was, Shadow saw that there was nothing on it. "Entei and its friends are gone," he murmured.</p>
<p class='Para'>"Yeah," Sorrel replied as he started walking towards Shadow.</p>
<p class='Para'>In Shadow's lap, Charmander began waking up. "Hey, Charmander!" Shadow cheered. "Are you feeling better?" he asked as he lifted it from its blanket and set it down standing on the ground.</p>
<p class='Para'>"Char, Charmander!" was the healthy response Shadow received, Piplup running over and cheering for it.</p>
<p class='Para'>Sorrel bent down next to the small lizard. "Let's see. Your tail flame looks good. Yep," he affirmed as Charmander shifted its tail to show him. "That tells me you're back to being fine."</p>
<p class='Para'>"Isn't that great, Charmander?" Shadow asked, getting another "Charmander!" as the response. But there was still something he had to ask. "Hey, do you want to come with us? I'd like us to become good friends!"</p>
<p class='Para'>Charmander's face darkened, clearly remembering its experience with Cross. But with a "Please?" from Shadow, it looked up. "Char&hellip;mander!" it said affirmatively.</p>
<p class='Para'>"You really mean it?" Shadow asked.</p>
<p class='Para'>"Charmander!"</p>
<p class='Para'>Shadow pulled out an empty Pok&#233;ball from his pocket. "Then here goes," he said, offering it to Charmander, who happily pressed the button and disappeared in a trail of red light. When the familiar <i>ding</i> resonated throughout the cave, Shadow felt overjoyed. "Yeah! I just caught a Charmander!" he yelled ecstatically, Lucario shouting next to him.</p>
<p class='Para'>"Congratulations, Shadow," Verity said. "You too, Lucario."</p>
<p class='Para'>Sorrel walked over to his pack and began searching through it. "We don't have a lot of supplies left," he said aloud. "We should head into town."</p>
<p class='Para'>Verity opened her tiny map, a worried look on her face. "No signal in here," she murmured.</p>
<p class='Para'>"Then let's head outside," Shadow countered. "It'll be good to stretch our legs."</p>
<p class='Para'>"Mmhmm." Sorrel slung his pack over his back before he and his Lucario hopped down the ledge in sync. Verity held Piplup in her arms as she slid down the rock face, and Shadow leaped onto the ground, Lucario just behind him. The three of them walked towards a faint light shining opposite the side they entered from. "That must lead to the other side of the mountain," Sorrel remarked.</p>
<p class='Para'>When Shadow stepped outside, Sorrel's words came true: before him stood an infinitely large forest with rolling hills. In the distance, mountains formed the horizon, and above them, a rainbow stood tall.</p>
<p class='Para'>"It is said that Ho-Oh lives at the end of the rainbow," Sorrel said as his traveling partners stared at the scene in awe.</p>
<p class='Para'>Shadow's attention was diverted by a twinkling sound. Looking down, he saw a rainbow-colored glow emanating from his jacket. His friends gathered next to him as he took the Rainbow Wing from his pocket and held it in the air. A "Woah" escaped him as he stared at it; it was shining brightly. Angling it towards the base of the rainbow, he had to squint his eyes as the feather sparkled even brighter.</p>
<p class='Para'>"The legend says the Rainbow Wing will guide you," Sorrel muttered.</p>
<p class='Para'>"Then what's over there?" Shadow asked.</p>
<p class='Para'>Taking out his own map, Sorrel answered, "There are a number of steep mountains in that direction. The Raizen mountain range."</p>

<p class='Para'><i><b>"I'm going so fast!"</i></b></p>
<p class='Para'><i><b>Shadow shifted </i></b>his race car into sixth gear, speeding by on the tarmac raceway. <i>I'm so close to finishing in first</i>, he thought. Looking in his mirrors, he saw his opponents beginning to catch up to them, and adrenaline started pumping through his body. <i>Almost there! </i>The white checkered flag was just within reach.</p>
<p class='Para'>Suddenly, Shadow's vision changed. Instead of being in an intense race, he was lying in his bed in his messy, cluttered room; it was all just a dream. Sunlight was poking through the blinds on his window, indicating that it the day was already well underway. Across his room, he saw the remains of his car-shaped alarm clock; it looked like someone had thrown it.</p>
<p class='Para'>Shadow was still in the midst waking up, but once he realized what had happened, his mind snapped awake as he screamed aloud, "I'm late to the first day of school!"</p>
<p class='Para'>Opening his dresser to put on his regular clothes and taking a moment to appreciate a poster of his dream cars&mdash;three sleek, black stylistic vehicles&mdash;Shadow dashed out of his bedroom and down the stairs of the two-story house to the living room where his dad was already awake. Flabbergasted, Shadow asked him, "Why didn't you wake me up?" </p>
<p class='Para'>"I forgot," came the lame response.</p>
<p class='Para'>"Well, at least the school is close by." Shadow dashed out of the door and ran over to school in record time, despite the school being located at the top of a hill. Outside it was a teacher whom Shadow recognized as Professor Oak, watering some bushes outside the the tall, white building.</p>
<p class='Para'>"Oh, hello, Shadow," Oak called once he saw him. "Out of the four students that were late, you were the latest."</p>
<p class='Para'>Shadow groaned inwardly and headed straight to class. Once he arrived and found a seat, he learned that the class was studying rainbows.</p>
<p class='Para'>"Shadow, you're late!" Shadow heard Verity, his classmate and close friend, tell him. Another friend, Sorrel, also commented, "Did you forget your homework again?" Shadow wished he could sink into the floor.</p>
<p class='Para'>As the lecture trudged on, Shadow felt that something was missing from him. The color blue suddenly blurred under his desk, but he saw nothing when he looked under it.</p>
<p class='Para'>"What are you looking at?" Verity asked. </p>
<p class='Para'>"Oh, nothing," Shadow responded; it must have been his imagination.</p>
<p class='Para'>"You're weird," Sorrel said, Verity agreeing.</p>
<p class='Para'>Something outside the classroom caught Shadow's attention. Trying to focus on it, he thought he was seeing a giant rainbow-colored bird in the sky, but after rubbing his eyes it was just a plane.</p>
<p class='Para'>Once the lesson ended, Shadow headed straight to the rooftop, where grey floors met chain link fences. He looked out over the nearby forest and past the town beyond it, staring at the horizon, until he heard footsteps. Turning his head around, he saw Verity and Sorrel approaching him.</p>
<p class='Para'>"Do you ever get bored of the view?" Verity asked.</p>
<p class='Para'>"What do you think is out there; beyond the school?" Shadow returned, changing the subject.</p>
<p class='Para'>"Well," Sorrel began, "there's forest, and then a town, and then more forest and another town. Beyond that would be the sea." </p>
<p class='Para'>"After that?"</p>
<p class='Para'>"It's just more of the same," Verity replied.</p>
<p class='Para'>"I want to go and explore what's out there," Shadow said on a tangent. </p>
<p class='Para'>"That would be nice," Sorrel responded. </p>
<p class='Para'>"Yeah," Verity chimed in. "No school, you get to stay up as late as you want&hellip;you get absolute freedom."</p>
<p class='Para'>"Yeah," Shadow said, "and I always have my buddy&mdash;Oh," he stopped himself when he realized that his buddy no longer existed. Something blue flickered next to him for an instant and prompted him to start crying.</p>
<p class='Para'>"Shadow, are you okay?" Verity asked, Sorrel saying, "Pull yourself together!"</p>
<p class='Para'>Shadow looked up to reply, but he saw that they were gone; he was alone. Behind him, he heard something, and turned to see that same blue, hazy figure, standing and waving at him, though he couldn't make out what it was. He began running toward it, and was immediately amazed to see that the entire landscape changed to that of a town plaza. </p>
<p class='Para'>"Ha," he said weakly as he kept running toward the image, who had begun running away from him. "We used to run like this all the time." </p>
<p class='Para'>Suddenly, the ground started crumbling to pieces, as if reality itself was being torn. Ahead of him nothing but floating cubes of terrain existed. "Wait! Don't go!" he shouted desperately as he began parkouring on the cubes. The figure was very close now. <i>Just a little more&hellip;</i> Shadow jumped for it. What seemed like eternity to him elapsed before he connected with it.</p>
<p class='Para'>"Lucario!" Shadow shouted, remembering its name. He closed his eyes in comfort, but when he opened them again he found himself and Lucario high in the sky, atop a meadow. Shadow's heart jumped to his mouth as the two of them began falling. Shadow braced for impact as they neared the ground. It never came.</p>
<p class='Para'>Shadow opened his eyes and found himself in the waking world where he was before he fell asleep; the entire thing had been one big dream. His surroundings began coming back to him; the tree he was sitting against, the forest he was in&hellip;and then he looked ahead and saw Lucario staring back at him, repeating "Carr" nervously.</p>
<p class='Para'>Shadow jumped forward and hugged Lucario tight, crying profusely. "I'm so sorry; it was all my fault."</p>
<p class='Para'>He looked around and saw Verity and Sorrel standing to the right and left of him, respectively. Verity reached down and picked something up, and handed it to Shadow. It was the Rainbow Wing; full of color again. "I think you dropped this," she said jokingly. </p>
<p class='Para'>Shadow graciously accepted it before Verity's tone made a U-turn. "Do you have any idea how long we've been searching for you?" </p>
<p class='Para'>"You cannot expect to win every battle," Sorrel lectured. "It's the losses you grow strong from&hellip;but that's just my opinion. Come on, let's go somewhere else in this forest."</p>

<p class='Para'>The group makes a fire in a circular clearing of trees; a thin fog has rolled in, and it is still nighttime. Shadow is explaining the dream that he had, the others listening in closely. Verity is in shock at the very concept of a world without Pok&#233;mon. Sorrel, on the other hand, has a different perspective: it is possible for Pok&#233;mon to leave us. He describes a time in his early childhood: His parents were away most of the time, so the family Luxray took care of Sorrel. One day, however, Sorrel hurt himself outside in a blizzard and quickly started freezing. Luxray bounded across and laid down with him in the center to keep him from doing so. In the morning, when the blizzard was gone, Luxray was frozen solid; it had died smiling. A rescue team found Sorrel with Luxray, and as they carried him away, he screamed his protector&#8217;s name. Afterwards, Sorrel was reluctant to make friends with any Pok&#233;mon, until he found Lucario. Shadow and Verity are somber after hearing the tale and offer their condolences. Meanwhile, Marshadow slowly appears from Shadow&#8217;s shadow, but this time they spot it. Lucario is instantly aggressive and fires an Aura Sphere at Marshadow&#8217;s location, but it rescinds long before it would have hit. Instead, the Aura Sphere hits the tree and shakes it. A group of Primape come down from the branches and quickly gather the team in a circle, repeatedly launching them in the air. Sorrel advises Shadow to use Metapod, as fighting back would only make them madder. Shadow manages to dismount the circle of Primape and takes out Metapod; he holds it and has it use String Shot, running around the ring. The aggressors are ensnared, and everyone dismounts before they can attack again. While running, Metapod evolves into Butterfree. Shadow has it use Sleep Powder on the Primape, who had broken out of the String Shot, and they all fall asleep. The group then continues walking, no longer threatened. They quickly reach a stream, and Verity gets out her Lapras. They all board Lapras and begin sailing downstream.</p>

<p class='Para'>The group is still going downstream on Lapras&#8217; back when day breaks, but they eventually disembark and continue walking. As they are going through a forest and are about to reach a cliff, however, they hear a Pok&#233;mon scream off to the left. After looking, they identify it as a pink Butterfree who is being hunted by a Fearow. Shadow immediately goes to protect it, unleashing his own Butterfree and having it chase the Fearow away with Gust. When the belligerent flees, the two Butterfree stop for a second, the pink one thanking the other. Sorrel points out that the pink one is pink, as opposed to blue, and Verity concludes that it must be female. The pink Butterfree flies off. Once they are at the edge of the cliff, the Rainbow Wing begins glowing. Shadow takes it out of his pocket, and it lights a visible beam all the way to a mountain that isn&#8217;t too far away: Mount Tensei. They&#8217;re in front of another cliff when Shadow spots a swarm of Butterfree flying together in the distance. Sorrel comments that it&#8217;s mating season for the Butterfree right now. Shadow takes out his own Butterfree, and within a few seconds, the pink one from before flies down to greet them. Shadow encourages their relationship, saying that they are awesome together, but Verity warns that should the two Butterfree go off together, it would be goodbye. Shadow becomes distraught at the concept of saying goodbye, and Sorrel states that in the end, it is his decision. Butterfree itself flies down to Shadow, who asks it if it wants to go. Butterfree responds after hesitation by flying behind his back. Shadow says that it should go with the other Butterfree and that if they don&#8217;t go now, they will be left behind (in the background, the Butterfree swarm has continued flying some distance). As his Butterfree goes to be with the pink one, Shadow praises them, saying that they are both really great Pok&#233;mon (with a slight pause between &#8220;both&#8221; and &#8220;really&#8221;). As they begin waving goodbye to each other, Shadow and Butterfree both start crying profusely. They continue until the swarm has left; long after the sun has set. Shadow says that he is glad to have met Butterfree and that even though it&#8217;s not here, they are still good friends. Sorrel comments that though people raise Pok&#233;mon, Pok&#233;mon live their own lives. Suddenly, a bolt of lightning crashes down behind the group. Turning around, they witness Raikou, the third of the legendary trio, standing on top of a rock looking down at them. With another flash of lightning, Raikou is gone as soon as it appeared. Their resolve strengthened, the group pushes forward to reach Mount Tensei.</p>

<p class='Para'>The group is at the base of Mount Tensei, walking along through thick fog. Many Pok&#233;mon are scattered about, looking agitated, and Verity comments about it. Bonji suddenly says that it&#8217;s because they want to meet Ho-Oh and receive its power. Bonji gets down from the rock he was on and starts sniffing the air, catching a faint scent of Ho-Oh. Shadow pulls out the Rainbow Wing, and Bonji is amazed. Verity is surprised that he knows of it, and Sorrel recognizes him as being the author of the book in the library. Bonji says his name, explaining that for the past 20 years he&#8217;s been on a quest, searching for Ho-Oh being a part of his research. He elaborates that he&#8217;s pulled data from many places and that the data all shows Mount Tensei to be the place of Ho-Oh&#8217;s next appearance. They agree to travel together to the summit, and Bonji comments that the Rainbow Wing&#8217;s shine is the shine of youth and that it&#8217;s almost too beautiful for him to look upon. As they are walking, Bonji says that it&#8217;s probably thanks in large part to the Rainbow Wing that the group has come across Entei, Raikou, and Suicune. He goes on to say that Ho-Oh wants to know if there is a young person suitable enough to be the Rainbow Hero, which means that there may be someone guiding Shadow from the shadows. Shadow recalls seeing one, and Bonji says that it&#8217;s most likely the extremely rare Pok&#233;mon Marshadow. Marshadow is a guide from the shadows, and that when the Rainbow Wing&#8217;s color fades, it seals it back up and makes it right. The fog has been getting thinner as they&#8217;ve been walking uphill, and suddenly the Rainbow Wing glows; when Shadow takes it out, it lights a direct beam of light to a crystal rock at the summit. Bonji prophesizes that when a Rainbow Flower blooms upon Rainbow Rock, Ho-Oh shall appear, and Shadow is overexcited, running ahead.</p>

<br /><br /><br /><center>* * *</center><br /><br />

<p class='Para'>When the group makes it to the summit, they find that more Pok&#233;mon are standing on ledges, waiting. There is a circular area fit for a battlefield, and in front of them is Rainbow Rock. Sorrel says that that&#8217;s where Shadow should place the Rainbow Wing, and the latter runs over to plant it. However, Incineroar stops him, using Throat Chop in front of him to knock him back. Cross appears from behind the rock and demands the Rainbow Wing, saying that the Trainer who gets to battle Ho-Oh is the strongest and that he is said person. Sorrel defies that, saying that that&#8217;s not how it works, and Verity chimes in, saying that the one to battle Ho-Oh is the one chosen by it. Cross calls them soft, using the jingle &#8220;might makes right, and that&#8217;s it&#8221;. Answering Shadow&#8217;s questions, he declares weak people trash, and people that lose worse than trash. The Rainbow Wing suddenly glows, and Marshadow appears from Shadow&#8217;s shadow and jumps on top of a ledge. Shadow recognizes it as being Marshadow; Cross is satisfied to meet the guardian from the shadow; Sorrel says that it&#8217;s the Pok&#233;mon they saw that night; and Verity declares it cute. Bonji says that its only purpose is to observe the proceedings.</p>

<p class='Para'>Shadow releases Charmeleon from its Pok&#233;ball to battle Cross&#8217; Incineroar. The latter immediately starts with Flamethrower, which Charmeleon dodges. Charmeleon retaliates with Slash, which lands a direct hit. Incineroar uses Throat Chop, and Charmeleon hops around unharmed. Charmeleon uses Slash yet again, and the two are locked in a power contest. Incineroar then uses Flamethrower, and Charmeleon is caught directly, blocking the flames. While in the Flamethrower, however, it evolves into Charizard. Cross doesn&#8217;t care, saying that weak Pok&#233;mon who evolve are still weak. He continues with Throat Chop, and Charizard uses Slash; they end up hitting each other. Incineroar uses Flamethrower, and Charizard flies around to dodge it. Charizard uses Dragon Rage, and it&#8217;s a direct hit. Shadow commands Charizard to build up its power to end it with a big attack. Incineroar continues the onslaught with Fire Fang, and Charizard dodges. While it's in the air, Incineroar jumps and grabs it to bring it down. Before it hits the ground, Charizard uses Seismic Toss and flings Incineroar across the stage. Cross aims to end the fight with Flamethrower; Charizard does the same. It&#8217;s a fire contest, but Charizard&#8217;s flame powers into a fully-fledged fireball and Incineroar loses, unable to battle. Cross gets on his knees and returns Incineroar. Shadow takes out the Rainbow Wing and walks over to the Rainbow Walk, but after he walks by Cross, the latter says that he saw Ho-Oh too. Cross continues, saying that it didn&#8217;t give him the Rainbow Wing even after he&#8217;s done everything to become the strongest. He asks why it had to be Shadow, and that if Ho-Oh doesn&#8217;t consider him the strongest, he&#8217;ll crush it. Shadow intervenes, saying that he wants to get stronger as well, but explains that he only got this far with the help of his friends, so he knows that it&#8217;s not just about strength. Cross asks him what he even battles for, and Shadow responds that it&#8217;s because he wants to make friends. Cross doesn&#8217;t reply, instead running at Shadow and wrestling the Rainbow Wing away from him. He climbs up to the top of Rainbow Rock, the Rainbow Wing losing its color as he holds it, and places it where it should be. A dark beam appears from Rainbow Rock and clouds flood the sky. The ground turns corrupt and purple as well. Bonji comments that the Rainbow Wing loses its color when touched by one with an evil heart. Marshadow appears from the shadows and grabs Cross, tossing him aside; Lycanroc catches him. Bonji nervously repeats that Marshadow seals it back up and makes it right.</p>

<p class='Para'>Cross vows to pound Marshadow as well as he recovers from being thrown. Lycanroc uses Crush Claw, but before it makes it Marshadow fires a beam of darkness towards it; Lycanroc&#8217;s eyes turn purple, and it turns around, mind-controlled. It starts attacking Cross, who runs away from it. Just before a ball of energy hits Cross, Charizard flies in front of him, taking the blow. Verity asks if he sees it now that Charizard never forgot that he was once its trainer. Shadow comments that it&#8217;s just like Charizard to be awesome. Meanwhile, Marshadow fires more dark beams of light all around, mind-controlling every Pok&#233;mon around except for the group&#8217;s. An Electabuzz fires a Thunderbolt towards Cross and Charizard&mdash;the two jump away in response&mdash;and a Pidgeotto flies towards Bonji, Sorrel, and Shadow; Sorrel&#8217;s Lucario knocks it away. Bonji says that it looks as if Marshadow wants to control the group as well and that Ho-Oh will never appear now that it&#8217;s come to this. At Marshadow&#8217;s command, a group of Pok&#233;mon fire attacks at the group, forcing them to retreat. Bonji says that Shadow has got to get the Rainbow Wing back; Marshadow is getting its power from it, and only Shadow can get it back. Sorrel and Verity help defend Shadow while the latter starts making his way to Marshadow. Charizard Flamethrowers a Graveller and Magmar; Piplup uses Hydro Pump against a Pidgeotto; Charizard body slams an Arbok; Shadow runs on top of a charging Ryhorn; Sorrel&#8217;s Lucario uses Bone Rush to block a Graveller as well as the Ryhorn; and just before it fires a Stone Edge, Cross tackles Lycanroc, pinning it down. Lycanroc proceeds to bite Cross&#8217; arm; Cross remembers that it bit him the day they met as well. He commands Lycanroc to remember as well, and it snaps out of its trance. Shadow makes it to Marshadow and demands that it give him the Rainbow Wing; it responds by leaping down from the rock and firing dark balls of energy at Lucario. Lucario retaliates by dodging the first two and hitting the third one back with a Bone Rush; Marshadow deflects it. The two engage in close combat, Lucario still having a Bone Rush, but Marshadow lands a blow, and Lucario is knocked back. Behind the two, Sorrel&#8217;s Lucario is hit, but before the opposing Pok&#233;mon can do more damage Cross steps in with Lycanroc and counters an incoming fireball. However, a Nidoqueen and Nidoking both use Rock Throw, attacking the party with boulders. The defenders run away to avoid getting crushed. An Arbok wraps around Charizard&#8217;s neck, incapacitating it. Meanwhile, Lucario is hit again with one of Marshadow&#8217;s attacks, but Shadow is anything but deterred; Lucario keeps fighting. Marshadow begins glowing, its previously grey hair and eyebrows becoming green and red, respectively, and unleashes a flurry of energy balls. Lucario attempts to dodge them but is hit by one and subsequently all the others. Shadow responds immediately by having Lucario use Aura Sphere mid-air; Marshadow jumps in a kicking position. It is a power standoff, but Marshadow wins, and Lucario is directly hit. An explosion occurs from the energy exertion, knocking both Shadow and the rest of the party back.</p>

<p class='Para'>Shadow immediately gets back up to see Lucario lying on the ground a few feet away and runs toward it; while he does so, Marshadow stops glowing and stumbles for a second. As Shadow crouches down, he sees that the mind-controlled Pok&#233;mon are advancing on him; he picks up Lucario and runs away from them until he reaches the edge of a ledge. Turning back, he sees his opponents all lines up, ready to strike. Shadow attempts to run away, but the Nidoqueen fires a Flamethrower at him and hits him directly. The others try to advance and defend him but are suppressed by other enslaved Pok&#233;mon; Shadow is all on his own. When the dust from the impact clears, Shadow is on the ground a few feet away from Lucario; the two begin crawling towards each other. Out of the corner of his eye, he sees the other Pok&#233;mon continuing to encroach, and takes Lucario&#8217;s Pok&#233;ball and rolls it over to it, pleading for it to get inside. He says that he knows it can&#8217;t stand being inside Pok&#233;balls, but it would be protected. The other Pok&#233;mon start charging an attack, and Shadow stands up to face them. He turns his cap around and says with perfect clarity, &#8220;Now you look. I don&#8217;t think you know who you&#8217;re dealing with. I&#8217;m Shadow, from Pallet Town, and I&#8217;m gonna be the world&#8217;s&#8230;greatest Pok&#233;mon master! Mess with me, and you&#8217;re gonna lose!&#8221; Immediately as he says the last word the Pok&#233;mon fire, and Lucario runs to protect him. Shadow sees this and stops it, instead burying it in his arms to protect it. He lets out a scream as the blast hits, and he is knocked to the ground, Lucario next to him. He asks why Lucario won&#8217;t get in its Pok&#233;ball, and his partner replies in English, &#8220;It&#8217;s because&#8230;It&#8217;s because I always want&#8230;to be with you.&#8221; The other Pok&#233;mon charge one final shot, and Shadow forces Lucario into its Pok&#233;ball. Holding the Pok&#233;ball tightly to his chest, Shadow is hit by the attack. An explosion ensues, so great that it is visible from several mountains away. The rest of the party including Cross gathers to watch, and Charizard flings the Arbok off its neck. When the smoke clears, Lucario&#8217;s Pok&#233;ball rolls away, and Shadow&#8217;s hat lands on top of it. When Lucario comes out of the Pok&#233;ball, the hat is on top of it. In front of it is Shadow&#8217;s body, transparent with pure energy irradiating from it. The Rainbow Wing begins to disintegrate in Marshadow&#8217;s hand. Lucario takes the hat and attempts to place it on Shadow&#8217;s head, but as it puts it down the body fades away into nothingness; the Rainbow Wing completely disintegrates as well. When the last sparkles have disappeared, Lucario takes the hat and buries it in its face, crying out. A massive blast of Aura engulfs everything on top of the mountain; it is so strong that the clouds fade and reveal a blue sky. When the smoke disappears, the opposing Pok&#233;mon are no longer mind-controlled. Everybody focuses on Lucario, who is crying into the hat. It lets out a shout that reaches into the heavens.</p>

<p class='Para'>Shadow awakens where the final blast hit him, but one thing is severely different: the entire world, himself included, is grayscale. He gets up and asks where everybody is. He hears Lucario crying behind him and turns around. He takes a step in its direction, and suddenly the entire world changes: he is now standing in a color-filled grassy plain at sunset, though he himself is still greyscaled. In the waking world, particles begin to gather where Shadow&#146;s body was. Shadow hears Lucario again and starts running in its direction; the landscape changes again, the sky now being grey and the ground now being an endless grass plain. There are more particles where Shadow&#146;s body was, and they begin to move around more actively. As Shadow is running, he chuckles a little, commenting that they used to run like this all the time. The plain is suddenly filled with flowers as a small beam of light opens amid the particles. As Shadow continues running the sky changes to a blue color, and he starts running on top of water. The particles become more fantastic, and the beam enlarges to create a portal; Lucario drops the hat as it stares in amazement. Shadow is now running through a rainbow of colors as Lucario jumps into the portal; it appears in the sky in Shadow&#146;s reality as Shadow returns to running on water. Shadow jumps to meet Lucario and the two hug mid-air; once they connect Shadow&#146;s body becomes color again. The light in the waking world becomes dazzlingly bright, and when it fades, Shadow is alive, standing with Lucario. Verity and Sorrel run over to meet Shadow, and Sorrel comments that he&#146;s alright. Charizard also lets out a yell. Suddenly, particles begin gathering in Shadow&#146;s hand, and the Rainbow Wing reforms; the Rainbow Rock, as well as the floor, also return to a normal color. Bonji repeats that when a Rainbow Flower blooms on Rainbow Rock, Ho-Oh shall appear, and urges Shadow onward. Shadow climbs to the top of Rainbow Rock and deposits the feather; when he does so a brief flash of rainbow-colored light beams into the sky and a rainbow forms, Rainbow Rock being one of its bases. On the other end of the rainbow, Ho-Oh is flying towards them. Bonji continues speaking, now saying that the one who is guided by the Rainbow Wing may meet Ho-Oh and become the rainbow hero. Ho-Oh flies around in circles around the group, an aurora appearing that washes light onto them. Everyone&#146;s injuries, minus their clothing, are healed, and their power strengthened. Verity comments that it looks like everyone is healthy again, and Bonji chimes in, saying that it&#146;s the power of Ho-Oh. Meanwhile, Shadow nods to Lucario and yells out to Ho-Oh, &#147;Let&#146;s have a battle!&#148; The legendary bird tips its head and takes flight, Shadow and Lucario running over to take their place on the battlefield. Lucario and Ho-Oh engage in heated battle, which continues until long in the night. (No winner is declared.)</p>

<p class='Para'>The group arrives at the nearest Pok&#233;mon Center, and Shadow goes to heal Lucario. Nurse Joy asks who they battled this time, and Shadow responds truthfully. Nurse Joy unsuspectingly says that that&#8217;s nice until she realizes what he just said; Shadow laughs in response. Outside the Pok&#233;mon Center, the group says goodbye to Cross, who vows to battle Shadow again. Cross tells him not to lose to anyone before then before walking off.</p>

<p class='Para'>At a four-way crossroads, the group dissolves itself. Sorrel says that he&#8217;ll be going to learn about the legends of Articuno, Zapdos, and Moltres. Verity plans to go and see her mom again, and Shadow says that he&#8217;ll go his own way, working to become a Pok&#233;mon master. Sorrel hopes that they will meet again one day, and the three say in unison, &#8220;Then we&#8217;ll have a battle!&#8221; before walking their separate ways.</p>
