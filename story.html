	I. Shadow wakes up late to go to Professor Oak's lab to pick out a starter
	Pok&#233;mon. He realizes that the three starter Pok&#233;mon have already
	been chosen and is stuck with a Riolu, who is hesitant to trust him.
	Nonetheless, the two depart on their journey.
</p>
<p>
	a) Shadow is sleeping in bed, and in a dream throws his
	Pok&#233;ball-shaped alarm clock, disabling it. He then wakes up and
	realizes just how late he is to the ceremony. He quickly gets dressed in a
	full panic, stopping for a second to appreciate the poster on his wall
	depicting the three starter Pok&#233;mon, and heads outside of his room to
	tell his father about the ordeal. The two immediately head outside and
	hurry over to Professor Oak's lab. Once Shadow makes it there, he sees Oak
	outside giving water to an Oddish and Bellsprout. After saying hello, Oak
	recognizes him as being the fourth trainer of the day to receive a starter
	Pok&#233;mon. (Shadow is unbeknownst that the regular starter Pok&#233;mon
	are all unavailable.) Heading up the stairs to the central area, Shadow
	explains that he wants to pick a Charmander, but Oak tells him that it was
	already taken. He counters with Bulbasaur; same response. No luck with
	Squirtle. Shadow asks Oak what he could then do; would he start his journey
	without a Pok&#233;mon? The latter responds that he has one last
	Pok&#233;mon, but that is was&#8230;different. Shadow for the first time
	notices a Riolu standing on the balcony above them, and is quick to ask if
	that was the Pok&#233;mon Oak was referring to. Oak confirms, and Shadow
	immediately climbs up the stairs to greet his soon-to-be partner. The Riolu
	is hesitant to even say hello, however, and Shadow is forced to chase it
	around before they end up before Oak. He hands Shadow Riolu's Pok&#233;ball
	but explains the caveat that this Riolu hates being inside its
	Pok&#233;ball. Nonetheless, Shadow attempts to coax it inside but instead
	gets a laugh out of Riolu as the latter slaps its Pok&#233;ball into
	Shadow's face. Shadow mutters to himself what he would do with Riolu as
	they all prepare for Shadow to leave. Shadow thanks Oak for Riolu (he is
	confident he will earn Riolu's friendship despite its difficulty) and,
	after saying goodbye to both Oak and his father, heads out.
</p>
<p>
	II. On his journey, Shadow slowly begins to bond with Riolu. A Spearow
	swarm attacks and Shadow valiantly defends his partner from them. Riolu
	realizes the extent to which Shadow cares for him, and together they beat
	the Spearow swarm, marking the start of their actual friendship.
</p>
<p>
	a) Shadow is tugging along Riolu on a rope as the latter refuses to move,
	and Shadow mutters to himself if this is going to last the entire journey.
	Eventually, he gets fed up and unties Riolu, asking it to walk with him, to
	which it refuses. Exasperated, he looks around and spots a Pidgey perching
	in some tall grass. He immediately throws a Pok&#233;ball at it, but it
	reappears almost instantly, and Shadow remembers that he has to battle it
	first. He asks Riolu to battle to it, but instead, it climbs onto a rock
	and watches. Shadow picks up a rock, intending to fight it himself, but the
	Spearow flies off. Shadow throws the rock anyways, which hits a different
	Spearow. It mistakes Riolu as being the one who threw the rock and begins
	attacking it. Doing something other than lazing around for the first time,
	Riolu fights back with a Force Palm, driving the Spearow into a tree which
	triggers a thousand more to come out and attack. Shadow and Riolu
	immediately begin running away as rain starts to pour down, chased by the
	flock, but they are two quick and quickly overtake Riolu. Shadow pushes his
	way to the center and picks up Riolu, protecting it and proceeding to run
	away. More running leads them to run straight off a cliff into a river, and
	when they resurface, they find the Spearow are still chasing them. Yet more
	running leads them to fall into a ditch. Shadow puts Riolu behind him and
	asks it to go into its Pok&#233;ball, and then stands in front of it and
	taunts the Spearow. Just before the flock attacks Shadow, though, Riolu
	jumps up and uses an Aura Sphere (This Riolu is one of the few who know the
	move before evolving), which drives the flock away. Shadow and Riolu then
	realize the bond that they have just formed. The clouds clear-it's still
	daytime-and Ho-Oh, one of the legendary Pok&#233;mon of Kanto, flies over
	and drops a Rainbow Wing over Shadow, who picks it up. For a second, Shadow
	is mystified. He then promises Riolu that one day they would meet the
	Pok&#233;mon (Shadow doesn't know its name yet). The two then make their
	way to a Pok&#233;mon center to heal.
</p>
<p>
	III.
	<em>
		Time fast-forwards, a lot. Shadow now has three Gym badges, and his
		bond with Riolu has strengthened immensely (although it hasn't evolved
		yet).
	</em>
	Shadow catches a Caterpie in the wild before stumbling across a
	Pok&#233;mon Center, and heads in, healing his Pok&#233;mon and calling his
	dad on one of the telephones. He gets word that Entei, one of the legendary
	Pok&#233;mon of Kanto, is near. After abruptly hanging up on his dad, he
	heads outside immediately to try to battle it. After some searching, he
	finds it in a clearing, but not before meeting Verity, a different Trainer
	who also wants to battle Entei with her Piplup. On the other side of the
	clearing is yet another trainer, Sorrel, with a Lucario who <em>also </em>
	wants to fight. The three battle Entei, but make no progress before the
	legendary Pok&#233;mon bounds away, and they all argue for a second. Sorrel
	leaves, and Shadow and Verity begin a fight before they disturb an Onyx.
	The two and their Pok&#233;mon are chased before they manage to calm the
	Onyx down. Shadow then discovers a Charmander that had been left out in the
	rain by Cross, a Trainer who believes strength is the only thing that
	matters to a Pok&#233;mon, and proceed to take it into a cave where Sorrel
	also is after Cross refuses to take it back. Charmander is treated-its
	flame very nearly went out in the rain-and the three Trainers talk about
	themselves. Sorrel explains the legend about Ho-Oh and the legendary trio
	(Entei, Raikou, and Suicune), and upon Shadow revealing the Rainbow Wing
	suggests that they all travel to Mount Tensei where Ho-Oh is said to appear
	is a Rainbow Wing is placed. Entei suddenly appears with other wild
	Pok&#233;mon and rests on a platform on the other side of the cave. Shadow
	offers to keep Charmander warm, and they all sleep until morning.
</p>
<p>
	a) Shadow is on a call with his father about how his journey is going so
	far. The latter is merely concerned about Shadow's wellbeing, and Shadow
	quickly loses his patience. Nurse Joy comes out of her back room and
	informs Shadow that Riolu has been healed; it is on top of a cart that
	Nurse Joy's Chansey is carrying. Riolu climbs up onto Shadow's shoulder and
	says hello. As they're talking, a different Trainer with a Vaporeon appears
	and talks about having battled Entei a few minutes ago. Shadow says a hasty
	goodbye to his dad and exits the Pok&#233;mon Center; other trainers exit
	as well. They're all looking for Entei. After some searching in the forest,
	Shadow sees Entei standing on top of a rock in a clearing. However, to his
	right is another trainer: Verity! Armed with a Piplup, she too wants to
	fight Entei and the two race to the clearing in hopes of being the first to
	battle. Once they make it, though, they see a third trainer, named Sorrel,
	with a Lucario on the other side of the clearing. All three of them try to
	fight Entei, but Entei disdains the attack and flees to elsewhere. Shadow
	and Verity argue, accusing each other of being the reason Entei fled, and
	the two agree to a battle. Sorrel, on the other hand, refuses to fight, and
	leaves with Lucario, telling them that it's due to rain again soon.
	Verity's Piplup's Hydro Pump misses Riolu and instead hits what was thought
	to be rocks outside of the clearing, but to both of their horror, an Onyx
	rises, maddened. Both Trainers and their Pok&#233;mon flee the scene, and
	after a long chase through a rock ravine Shadow manages to calm the Onyx
	down. True enough, it begins raining again, and Shadow and Verity decide to
	find shelter together. On the way, they encounter a Charmander sitting on a
	rock. Shadow wonders who put it there when another person, Cross, appears,
	with a Midnight Form Lycanroc. He explains that since the Charmander was
	weak, there was no sense in keeping it, and so he left it out in the rain
	to toughen it up. Shadow is disgusted by this, and Cross walks away. Verity
	notes that the fire on Charmander's tail is extremely small-if it ever went
	out completely&#8230;The two resolve to find shelter, fast, and make it to
	a cave. Upon entering, they find that Sorrel had taken refuge in there as
	well. Sorrel at first becomes mad at Shadow for leaving the Charmander in
	the rain, but Verity explains the situation. Sorrel gladly agrees to heal
	the Charmander, and after feeding it medicine wraps it in cloth to keep
	warm. Shadow vouches to hold it to spread his body heat. The three begin
	discussing their pasts; Shadow and Verity are both on journeys, and Sorrel
	wants to learn more about the legendary Pok&#233;mon of Kanto. He proceeds
	to tell them both the tale of the Burned Tower, and how Ho-Oh resurrected
	them. He also gives a picture, which Shadow immediately recognizes. He
	pulls out the Rainbow Wing from his jacket pocket, and the two marvel at
	it. Sorrel explains that Ho-Oh gives the Rainbow Wing to a Trainer that it
	likes-a so-called "rainbow hero" that is destined to battle the legendary
	Pok&#233;mon-and suggests that Shadow travel to Mount Tensei, where Ho-Oh
	is said to come if a Rainbow Wing is placed. The three decide to travel to
	Mount Tensei together. Just then, Entei arrives in the cave along with some
	wild Pok&#233;mon, and takes up residence on an elevated spot in the cave,
	taking special notice of Shadow's Rainbow Wing. The three leave it alone,
	and Sorrel says that it's going to be cold despite the existence of a fire.
	He puts his Lucario back into its Pok&#233;ball, as does Verity with
	Piplup, but Shadow explains that Riolu does not appreciate being in its
	Pok&#233;ball. The other two Pok&#233;mon hop out of their Pok&#233;balls
	as well, and they all spend the night sleeping together.
</p>
<p>
	IV. Shadow convinces Charmander to travel along with him, and the entire
	party sets off towards Mount Tensei. They begin walking to a nearby town
	but not before going for a swim. Shadow battles a Pinsir with Caterpie, and
	it evolves into Metapod. That same night, Verity sees Suicune and shares it
	with the group while they continue walking. Once they make it to the city,
	Shadow does not waste time battling. He wins against a Jigglypuff using
	Charmander, and the latter evolves to Charmeleon. Sorrel begins to research
	more about Ho-Oh at the library the following day. He finds information
	about Ho-Oh regarding its presence in the past. Shadow decides to fight
	some trainers at the local battleground while they're here and gets on a
	winning streak with Riolu. After defeating a Snorlax, Cross comes up and
	challenges Shadow, this time using an Incineroar. Shadow uses Charmeleon,
	believing that he could win through the sheer faith that Cross' training
	strategy is incorrect. However, Charmeleon is savagely beaten, and Cross
	smugly walks away. Shadow is unable to believe the loss, and openly admits
	that had he used Riolu he would have won. He runs away into the forest, the
	others chasing after him. Verity and Sorrel fall behind, but Riolu keeps
	pace. After Riolu says that it disagrees with him, Shadow says that he
	wishes that he had chosen a different starter Pok&#233;mon entirely. Riolu
	stops following him, standing in one place while Shadow walks away until it
	is out of sight. Shadow asks himself if he even needs Riolu, sitting down
	against a tree. Taking the Rainbow Wing out of his pocket, he wonders if he
	really is the rainbow hero. Marshadow appears from behind him unnoticed and
	puts him in a sleep-like trance. The Rainbow Wing falls from his hand and
	loses its color.
</p>
<p>
	a) Riolu is the first to wake up the following morning and immediately
	notices that the rain has stopped and that Entei has gone. The others start
	waking up and when Shadow awakes he sees that Charmander's tail flame is
	back to full strength. Shadow asks Charmander if it would like to go with
	him, and after a slight bit of hesitance, it agrees. Shadow puts it in a
	Pok&#233;ball. They all decide to vacate the cave, and after looking at
	Sorrel's map start heading for the nearest town. First, though, they go for
	a swim (minus Sorrel and Lucario, who stay dry sitting against a tree).
	Shadow ends up fighting a Pinsir with Caterpie, and after flinging the
	former down with a String Shot the latter evolves into Metapod. The Pinsir
	gets away, but Shadow is just happy that his Pok&#233;mon evolved. Once
	they make it inside the (unnamed) town, Shadow wastes no time going
	straight to the local battlefield, where he and Charmander face off against
	a Jigglypuff. Charmander wins and evolves to Charmeleon while running back
	to Shadow. The next day, they all head towards the library, where Sorrel
	begins researching more about Ho-Oh and the rainbow hero prophecy. He
	uncovers more information about the legendary Pok&#233;mon: long ago, Ho-Oh
	watched over the works of people and Pok&#233;mon, and everyone was given
	energy via an aura of happiness. However, a heart of evil touched the
	Rainbow Wing and its color vanished. Shadow heads back to the battlefield.
	After defeating a Snorlax, Cross comes up and challenges him, saying that
	he heard a rumor that Shadow was using Charmander [<em>sic</em>]. When
	Shadow sends out Charmeleon, Cross maintains that weak Pok&#233;mon who
	evolve are still weak. Shadow is sure that he will win as he is up against
	incorrectly-trained Pok&#233;mon. Cross uses Incineroar, and Shadow uses
	Charmeleon-Cross comments that useless Pok&#233;mon that evolve are still
	useless. Despite Shadow's and Charmeleon's tenacity, Charmeleon is badly
	defeated, and Cross proceeds to insult Shadow, citing that he relied on
	cheap friendship and tried to use moves he couldn't use. Shadow has no
	retort. He can't believe his loss and is extremely upset despite Verity's
	and Sorrel's attempts to console him. He openly admits that he would have
	won had he used Riolu instead, and runs away into the forest when Sorrel
	calls him out on being no better than Cross if that was his mindset. The
	others chase him, but Riolu is the only one who keeps pace; Verity and
	Sorrel are left behind. Eventually, Shadow slows to a walk, still walking
	away, and declares the two losers. He asks if Riolu agrees with him, to
	which it says no. Shadow says that he wishes that he had chosen Bulbasaur
	or Squirtle instead. Riolu stops following Shadow and stands while the
	latter continues walking away until it is out of sight. When Shadow glances
	back, it is completely gone. Sitting down against a tree, he questions
	whether or not he even needs Riolu, and sits down against a tree. He takes
	out the Rainbow Wing and says to Ho-Oh that he thought he was the rainbow
	hero. Marshadow slowly appears from behind Shadow (he doesn't notice it)
	and possesses him, giving his eyes a purple glow and putting him into a
	sleep-like state. The Rainbow Wing falls out of Shadow's hand and is
	corrupted, losing its color.
</p>
<p>
	V. <em>(Dream)</em> Shadow wakes up in his room; his alarm clock did not
	work, and he had overslept. He quickly gets dressed in a full panic, not
	wanting to be late for the first day of school, and heads out towards
	Professor Oak's class. Once he makes it there, he says hello to Oak, who is
	watering some bushes. Oak comments that out of the four students who were
	late, he was the latest, and tells him to head to class. Once inside,
	Verity and Sorrel berate him, the former calling him out for his lateness
	and the latter on not doing the homework. Shadow tries to listen to the
	lesson about rainbows but loses his focus as he sees a flicker of something
	blue underneath his desk; his classmates Verity and Sorrel call him weird.
	He also sees Ho-Oh outside, but after doing a double take, it's just a
	plane. Once class ends, Shadow heads to the rooftop and looks outside of
	the chain fence gate. Verity and Sorrel come up; the former asks if the
	view would ever get boring and the latter asks what is on his mind. Shadow
	asks what's "way out there". Sorrel replies that it's the forest, a town,
	more forest, another town, and then the sea; he had never really given it
	any thought. Verity says that it's just more of the same. Shadow talks
	about wanting to leave the school, and Verity and Sorrel chime in, citing
	different advantages: no school, freedom, friends, etc. Shadow says that he
	will always have his buddy but stops himself; his buddy no longer exists.
	The same blue flicker appears on Shadow's shoulder, and suddenly he starts
	crying; Verity and Sorrel tell him to pull himself together. When Shadow
	looks up, they are both gone, but behind him is a hazy shape of his buddy.
	Running after it, Shadow finds himself in a plaza, still going. He comments
	that they used to run like this all the time, but still can't remember his
	partner's name. The ground starts to crumble, and Shadow jumps and catches
	it in his arms, remembering its name, Riolu. Suddenly, they begin falling
	from the sky above a meadow. When they hit the ground, Shadow wakes up
	underneath the tree; the first thing he sees is Riolu in front of him. He
	immediately breaks down crying and hugs Riolu, saying that it was all his
	fault. Beside him, the Rainbow Wing regains its color. Verity asks if
	Shadow even knew how long they'd been searching for him, and Sorrel
	lectures him, saying that you cannot expect to win every battle and that
	losing is how you grow stronger. They then leave to make camp somewhere
	else.
</p>
<p>
	a) Shadow is sleeping in bed, and in a dream throws his alarm clock,
	disabling it. He then wakes up and realizes just how late he is to the
	first day of school. He quickly gets dressed in a full panic, stopping for
	a second to appreciate the poster on his wall depicting three
	snazzy-looking cars, and heads outside of his room to tell his father about
	the ordeal. The former runs over to the school to avoid being late. Once
	Shadow makes it there, he sees Professor Oak, his teacher, outside giving
	water to bushes. After saying hello, Oak comments that out of the four
	students late, he was the latest. Shadow proceeds to his first class, where
	he attempts to focus on the current lesson: rainbows. However, he feels
	that something is missing in his day, and catches a glimpse of something
	blue below his desk. He looks over, but sees nothing; instead, his
	classmates Verity and Sorrel call him weird. Shadow also thinks he sees
	Ho-Oh in the skies, but upon closer inspection, it's just a plane. Once the
	class is over, Shadow walks up to the rooftop and stares outside of the
	chain link fence for a long time. Verity and Sorrel come up, Verity asking
	if Shadow ever got bored of the view. Shadow asks them what is beyond the
	school. Sorrel responds by saying there's forest, and then a town, and then
	more forest and another town; beyond that is the sea. Verity says that it's
	just more of the same after that. Shadow tells them that he wants to go
	explore what's out there. Verity and Sorrel chime in; no school, staying
	up, absolute freedom&#8230; Shadow says that he always has his buddy, but
	stops himself when he realizes that his "buddy" no longer exists. He sees a
	vision of his partner on his shoulder and begins to cry. His friends tell
	him to pull himself together, but when Shadow looks back up, they're gone.
	Behind him, he sees that same figure, hazy but there. He begins to run
	towards it, and he suddenly finds himself running along a plaza. He says
	that they used to run like this all the time. The ground starts crumbling
	into chunks and falling into the void, and Shadow tries to catch up. He
	jumps and catches his partner, remembering its name, Riolu. Suddenly, the
	two are transported to the skies above a meadow and fall to the ground in
	terror. When Shadow hits the ground, he wakes up in the waking world, still
	underneath the tree. He immediately sees Riolu in front of him and hugs it,
	crying and saying that it was all his fault. Beside him, the Rainbow Wing
	regains its color. Verity asks Shadow if he had any idea how long they'd
	been searching for him, and Sorrel lectures him, saying that you cannot
	expect to win every battle and that it's the losses that you grow strong
	from, but that's just his opinion. Shadow gets up, and the group goes
	elsewhere in the forest.
</p>
<p>
	VI. The group makes camp in a clearing of trees and Shadow starts
	explaining his dream. Verity is in disbelief at the concept of a world
	without Pok&#233;mon, but Sorrel has a different take on it: it's not
	impossible for Pok&#233;mon to leave us. He goes on to talk about a point
	in his childhood when his parents were frequently away, and so the family
	Luxray took care of him. One day, however, Sorrel injures himself against a
	tree out in the cold snow by accident. Luxray bounds over and curls up next
	to him to stop him from freezing. When morning comes, Luxray is frozen
	solid; it died smiling. The rescue team finds Sorrel and takes him away;
	the latter is screaming out Luxray's name in tears as he is dragged away.
	Present-day Sorrel explains that after that, he was reluctant to make
	friends with any Pok&#233;mon until he met his Lucario. Marshadow suddenly
	appears behind Shadow and is noticed, unlike its other appearances. Riolu
	gets agitated and fires an Aura Sphere at the spot where Marshadow was, but
	it had already rescinded into Shadow's shadow; instead, Riolu hits the
	tree, triggering a group of Primape to come down. The Primape get in a
	circle and begin throwing the group in the air until Sorrel advises Shadow
	to use Metapod to calm them. Shadow gets off and releases the Pok&#233;mon,
	holding it and having it use String Shot to ensnare the Primape. Once they
	are no longer a threat, the group dismounts and runs away until they reach
	a stream. After calming down, Verity calls upon her Lapras, and they use it
	to travel downstream.
</p>
<p>
	VII. The following morning (they had spent the entire night on Lapras'
	back), the group continues heading towards Mount Tensei. Eventually, they
	reach a cliff that shows a good view of the mountain before they hear a
	scream. Looking over to his left, Shadow spots a pink Butterfree being
	attacked by a Fearow and decides to save it. He throws his own Butterfree
	out of its Pok&#233;ball, and after a quick Gust, the Fearow is driven
	away. The two Butterfree hug, Verity pointing out that the pink one must be
	female.
</p>
