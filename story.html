<p class='Para'><i><b>"Charmander, I choose you!"</i></b></p>
<p class='Para'><i><b>Shadow planted </i></b>his foot on the dirt battlefield, ready to begin his first Pok&#233;mon battle. He gripped his brown leather belt and picked up a shiny, red-and-white sphere; his new Pok&#233;mon partner's Pok&#233;ball. With a great force he threw it across the dirt, and it bounced on the ground. A dazzling white light revealed a flame-orange salamander that stood on two legs. A fire burned intensely on the tip of its tapering tail, telling its Trainer it was raring to fight.</p>
<p class='Para'>On the other half of the battlefield was a different Trainer; Shadow's opponent. With a similar velocity, he let loose a Pok&#233;ball as well, revealing a small, bipedal, teal-colored tortoise with a bright orange shell that Shadow recognized as a Squirtle. <i>A Water-type against a Fire-type, </i>Shadow thought. <i>We're at a type disadvantage. But I won't let that stop me!</i></p>
<p class='Para'>"Charmander, use Ember!" Shadow confidently commanded, eager to begin the fight. Charmander inhaled a large volume of air, and just as quickly expelled a bright spark of fire from its mouth that travelled across the battlefield and directly struck the Squirtle. "That's how you do it, Charmander, great job!"</p>
<p class='Para'>Suddenly a quiet voice started speaking into Shadow's ear. Taking his eyes off of the battle, he strained to hear it. It sounded as if were saying "wake up".</p>
<p class='Para'>Shadow instantaneously opened his real-world eyes. Squinting from sunlight peering in through a window, he made out his own bedroom; a small, rectangular space filled with many Pok&#233;mon-related dolls, plushies, and other accessories. On the floor, next to his bed, lay a broken, Pok&#233;ball-shaped alarm clock. Directly to the left of it was his father, standing in the doorway, saying something.</p>
<p class='Para'>"Shadow, I thought you said that when you turned ten, you would start waking yourself up," he said concernedly.</p>
<p class='Para'>Shadow snapped out of his half-awake state. "I'm late for Professor Oak's ceremony!" he spoke aloud. Without bothering to get dressed he skedaddled through the doorway and down the stairs, tripping on one of them and comically falling. "Ow," he groaned as he got up, but he paid no heed and sprinted out of the house.</p>
<p class='Para'>Professor Oak's laboratory wasn't too far from Shadow's house. As he climbed the grassy hill that led to it, Shadow found himself wondering how he had let this happen. <i>Of course! When I threw Charmander's Pok&#233;ball in my dream, I actually threw my alarm clock. Why did I do that? </i>He arrived at the summit in record time. Ahead of him was the lab&mdash;a large, multistory science center&mdash;and just outside of its grand front door, Shadow spotted Professor Oak with a watering can, giving water to a couple of plant Pok&#233;mon.</p>
<p class='Para'>"Professor Oak!" Shadow caught up to the Pok&#233;mon researcher. "I'm here, to receive, my new, Pok&#233;mon," he added, out of breath.</p>
<p class='Para'>"Oh, so you're the fourth Trainer to receive a new Pok&#233;mon today. Come on inside," Oak invited. Shadow followed him into a nicely decorated lobby, taking time to regain his composure as they walked. As they walked up stairs to presumably where Shadow would be receiving his new Pok&#233;mon, he blurted out, "I've thought about it a lot, and I've decided I'm going to choose Charmander!"</p>
<p class='Para'>"I'm afraid Charmander has already been chosen by a Trainer who wasn't late," Oak replied.</p>
<p class='Para'>Shadow was crestfallen for a few moments, but it faded quickly. "Then I'll pick Bulbasaur!" The image of the green turtle-esque Pok&#233;mon filled his thoughts.</p>
<p class='Para'>"Bulbasaur was already chosen as well." </p>
<p class='Para'>"Alright. Then I'll go with Squirtle!"</p>

<p align='justify'><i>&nbsp;</i></p>
<p class='Para'><i><b>"Is this going to last the</i></b> entire journey?" </p>
<p class='Para'>Shadow was quickly growing exasperated as he walked up a hill, dragging Riolu behind him with a rope that was tied around it. He had been doing so for the past while and was beginning to tire. </p>
<p class='Para'>Eventually, he gave up. Walking over to Riolu, he untied it. Kneeling down, he asked, "Can you please walk with me?" </p>
<p class='Para'>Riolu simply shook its head in response; a no.</p>
<p class='Para'>"Do you even like me?" Shadow pressed.</p>
<p class='Para'>Riolu shook its head even more.</p>
<p class='Para'>"Well, we're stuck here together anyway. Come on," he said, extending a hand, "put her there."</p>
<p class='Para'>Riolu turned its back to him, and he gave up. Looking around, Shadow spotted a Pidgey&mdash;a bird Pok&#233;mon&mdash;and decided to catch it. Taking out a Pok&#233;ball that didn't contain anything inside, he threw it at the wild bird and with satisfaction watched it get sucked inside.</p>
<p class='Para'>Almost immediately, however, the Pidgey sprang right back out of the Pok&#233;ball. <i>Oh, right!</i> Shadow thought. <i>I need to battle it first.</i></p>
<p class='Para'>"Come on Riolu, let's battle this Pidgey!" Shadow excitedly shouted, hoping that something interesting like a battle would elicit a response.</p>
<p class='Para'>Instead, Riolu climbed on top of a nearby rock and sat down, apparently to watch the show. <i>Would you like some popcorn?</i> Shadow sardonically asked in his mind.</p>
<p class='Para'>"Alright then." Shadow picked up a small stone on the ground. "Looks like I have to do things the old-fashioned way!" He threw the rock just as the Pidgey flew away, and the rock ended up landing somewhere else. A few seconds later he saw a different bird&mdash;a Spearow&mdash;appear with a large bump on its head.</p>
<p class='Para'>Next to him, Riolu started laughing as the Spearow looked around for who threw the rock. It spotted the former and flew off to fight it back, and Shadow tensed. However, unlike the other times, Riolu didn't laze around and instead fought it off by expelling energy from its paw in a move called Force Palm. </p>
<p class='Para'>The Spearow flew away into a large tree not far away, and just a few moments after it did so what must have been a thousand more began pouring out of the tree, converging on Riolu!</p>
<p class='Para'>Shadow immediately dove into the flock, batting aside Spearow until he made it to the center where Riolu was badly injured. Deflecting their attacks, he picked up Riolu and began to run away as clouds began to darken the sky.</p>
<p class='Para'>The Spearow continued to follow him as rain and lightning began to crash down, soaking Shadow. Not being able to see where he was going, Shadow felt the ground disappear him and after it was too late realized that he had just run off a cliff! For a few seconds, he plummeted, Riolu still in his arms, until he hit a river at the bottom. Underneath the surface, Shadow swam towards Riolu as fast as he could, narrowly dodging a giant sea dragon called Gyarados along the way.</p>
<p class='Para'>The two surfaced at the bank of the river a few moments later and they caught their breath. Just before Shadow said that he thought they were in the clear, however, the swarm began flying over the cliff and diving towards them. Shadow picked up Riolu again and continued running away until he fell into a ditch in the ground. He let go of Riolu as he fell, and the two lay a couple of feet from each other.</p>
<p class='Para'>As he looked at the battered Riolu, Shadow began to realize what he had done. "This is all my fault," he faintly said as he began to cry. Unhooking Riolu's Pok&#233;ball from his belt, he rolled it over to Riolu and pleaded, "Please get inside. I know you hate being inside Pok&#233;balls, but you'll be safe in there." </p>
<p class='Para'>There was no more time to say anything else. Shadow heard the Spearow flock getting closer. Getting up, he walked in front of Riolu as the birds began circling around, and gave them a taunt: "Now you look. I don&#8217;t think you know who you&#8217;re dealing with. I&#8217;m Shadow, from Pallet Town, and I&#8217;m gonna be the world&#8217;s greatest Pok&#233;mon master! Mess with me and you&#8217;re gonna lose!"</p>
<p class='Para'>As he said those words the flock dove down upon him. Time slowed down as lightning struck and Shadow witnessed Riolu climb onto his shoulder and jump off of it, releasing a brilliant blast of teal-colored Aura in the process. </p>
<p class='Para'>When the light faded away, Shadow saw in awe as the flock of Spearow flew away, not bothering him anymore. In front of him was Riolu, covered in scratches like him but standing proudly.</p>
<p class='Para'>It was then that what had just happened clicked in Shadow's mind. He picked Riolu up and hugged it, realizing now what a true bond was like. The clouds began to clear, revealing a still-sunny sky. </p>
<p class='Para'>Above him, he heard a bird call. Looking up, he saw a magnificent rainbow-colored Pok&#233;mon fly by and squinted as something fell down from it in front of him. Picking it up from the air, he saw that it was a rainbow-colored wing.</p>
<p class='Para'>"Riolu," he said determinedly, "one day we're going to meet that Pok&#233;mon."</p>

<p class='Para'><i><b>"Let's go, Riolu! Use Force Palm!" </i></b></p>
<p class='Para'>Shadow was in the middle of an intense battle against Erika, leader of the Celadon City Gym. Since the fateful first day of his journey, he has acquired two Gym Badges with Riolu, and was in the middle of earning his third.</p>
<p class='Para'>Indeed, Riolu ran across the dirt battlefield inside of the pretty, Grass-type-themed gym towards its opponent, Erika's Tangela, which was little more than a mass of tangled, blue vines coupled with eyes and red, boot-like feet. Placing its paw on Tangela, who was too exhausted from prior battling to retaliate, Riolu let out a bright flash of energy that sent Tangela flying across the gym and slamming into a wall beyond Erika. Looking closely, Shadow could see that instead of regular eyes, it had swirls, an indication that it was fainted and could no longer continue battling. </p>
<p class='Para'>Erika dipped her head in recognition and walked towards Shadow, clad in a kimono. "Your Riolu has a lot of strength," she said, taking something out of her pocket and holding it out to Shadow. It was a small, metal trinket shaped like a flower, with each petal a different color in the spectrum. "Take this Rainbow Badge as proof of your victory at the Celadon Gym." </p>
<p class='Para'>Shadow gingerly picked up the badge, and once the overwhelming euphoria in his mind cleared, he thrust it into the air, shouting, "Yes! I got the Rainbow Badge!" Riolu also shouted in joy, having run over to stand next to him. </p>
<p class='Para'>As Shadow put the Rainbow Badge into a case containing the other two Badges, he saw something flashing in his peripherals. Looking over to his left, he saw that Riolu had started glowing! He watched in awe as his two-foot companion grew to be three feet and changed shape entirely, and once the transformation completed, sparkles appeared as it reverted to a normal color.</p>
<p class='Para'>This new Pok&#233;mon looked a little similar to Riolu, borrowing a similar color palette. Its legs were mostly unchanged save for being longer, and its waist now featured blue fur that closely resembled shorts. Its tail was more defined and the kink in it was sharper, and its paws now had a black color to them that connected to its blue-furred arms in spikes, and the previous white bumps had now grown to fully-fledged spikes. Where its waist connected with its upper body now existed a black ring of fur, and its torso sported tan-colored with a spike not unlike the other two in the middle of its chest as well as a small tuft of fur where the black ring was. Its shoulders had black rings connecting to its chest. The collar that Riolu had was now replaced with a scruff of fur that jutted out. Where Riolu had two appendages on the back of its head, there were now four, grouped into pairs of two. The bandit mask Riolu had was now extended, curving around both the side of its head and over the top between its ears, which were much longer and now had black insides, before connecting at the back of its head. Shadow recognized this new Pok&#233;mon at once: Lucario, the evolution of Riolu.</p>
<p class='Para'>Shadow was at a loss for words as Lucario smirked at him, and it was all he could do to ecstatically high-five it. Thanking Erika, who had simply stood and smiled throughout the process, he headed out outside of the Gym and, along with Lucario, went for a walk in a nearby forest to clear his thoughts.</p>
<p class='Para'>"So," he said half to himself, after a few minutes of walking, "you've evolved, huh? That's so amazing&mdash;just imagine all the things you can do now." He chuckled a little bit, adding, "It's hard to believe that, back at Professor Oak's lab, you hated me. Now look at us, going on a journey and you evolving. Know this, Lucario: If we were in a life-or-death scenario, and it was between saving you and saving myself, I'd choose you."</p>
<p class='Para'>After he finished speaking, Lucario stopped and hugged Shadow, and while it couldn't speak English, it made it clear it felt the same way.</p>
<p class='Para'>Suddenly, Lucario looked up. Following its gaze, Shadow saw that a Caterpie&mdash;a green, caterpillar-esque Pok&#233;mon&mdash;was perched on a tree branch above them looking like it wanted to fight. Despite having just been in one, Lucario looked raring to battle as well.</p>
<p class='Para'>"Alright," Shadow said enthusiastically, walking a few steps back to give Lucario room, "this'll be your first battle as a Lucario, so let's start off strong! Use Aura Sphere!" Lucario put up both of its paws and a small teal-colored sphere began forming in front of them. Firing, the Aura Sphere homed in on Caterpie&mdash;a nice feature of the move that prevented it from ever missing&mdash;and hit it, knocking it off the branch.</p>
<p class='Para'>However, Caterpie was ready to retaliate, using what Shadow identified as String Shot and shooting webs at the branch it was just on to catapult itself into Lucario, where it then repeatedly bit it with Bug Bite. <i>Clever</i>, Shadow thought, <i>but it won't get you far.</i></p>
<p class='Para'>"Use Force Palm to launch Caterpie away!" Despite being nipped all over, Lucario grabbed Caterpie with one paw and blasted it with energy with the other, sending the small caterpillar flying back. </p>
<p class='Para'><i>Now's my chance!</i> Shadow took an empty Pok&#233;ball from his bag and, determined to catch something this time, threw it at Caterpie. It was sucked inside, and both Shadow and Lucario stood tensely while the sphere wobbled. After what felt like an eternity, it stopped wobbling and Shadow heard a <i>ding </i>that told him that the Pok&#233;ball had succeeded in capturing Caterpie. </p>
<p class='Para'>"Yes!" he shouted. "I caught Caterpie!" Lucario joined in as well with a loud "Carr!" </p>
<p class='Para'>Picking up Caterpie's Pok&#233;ball, Shadow lightly tossed it onto the ground in order to release the Pok&#233;mon inside. In a brilliant flash, Caterpie appeared; however, it was still scratched up.</p>
<p class='Para'>"Come on," Shadow said gently, picking up Caterpie and putting it on his shoulder. "Let's go to a Pok&#233;mon Center," he announced and began walking again.</p>
<p class='Para'>As luck would have it, the path they were walking on led directly back to town, so Shadow didn't have to go too far to make it to his destination. Once inside the building, he handed over Lucario and Caterpie to Nurse Joy, the nurse in charge of the Pok&#233;mon Center, and sat down on a nearby couch as he waited.</p>
<p class='Para'>The Pok&#233;mon Center was a hotspot for Trainers; Shadow couldn't begin to count how many other people were present. <i>I wonder what that would be like, travelling with other people.</i> Little did he know, he would be experiencing just that soon.</p>
<p class='Para'>"Shadow, your Pok&#233;mon are ready for pickup," Nurse Joy announced over the intercom. Shadow walked to the front desk where he received Caterpie and Lucario&mdash;the latter of which who had been riding on the cart that they were brought back on&mdash;, thanked Nurse Joy, and put Caterpie into its Pok&#233;ball. He then, along with Lucario, took some time to call his dad on one of the phones.</p>
<p class='Para'>Initially, his father seemed worried about Shadow's wellbeing, pestering him with questions such as "Are you eating alright?" and "Are you flossing?". When Lucario stepped in front of the phone booth&mdash;in addition to audio calls it also allowed for video&mdash;Shadow's dad quickly changed from worry to surprise. Although Shadow knew that he was only being a parent, he was flustered.</p>
<p class='Para'>Shadow heard running footsteps beside him and turned around to see another Trainer holding a Vaporeon&mdash;an aquatic, blue Pok&#233;mon and one of the evolutions of the mysterious Eevee&mdash;frantically speaking to Nurse Joy. He couldn't catch everything the boy said, for he was talking too fast, but from what he did hear, he concluded that he had tried to battle Entei, a fearsome Legendary Pok&#233;mon, and lost miserably.</p>
<p class='Para'>His curiosity piqued, Shadow abruptly hung up on his dad who wasn't quite finished talking and ran out of the Pok&#233;mon Center along with many other Trainers doing the same thing he was: looking for Entei. </p>
<p class='Para'>Running through the forest he had just come from, Shadow looked around for Entei before he remembered that Lucario had a special power: an ability to sense the Auras of other living things and pinpoint their locations. Quietly, he asked it if it could do so to try to find Entei, and it nodded. Its appendages started levitating, becoming flush with the top of its head, and it held its paw out. After a few seconds of searching, it seemed to find something and ushered Shadow to follow it.</p>
<p class='Para'>The two stopped just before a clearing in the woods, and Shadow could see ahead that Entei was ahead. The huge beast was a Fire-type Pok&#233;mon, and though it was Legendary, Shadow was not deterred.</p>
<p class='Para'>Suddenly, another Trainer appeared off to his right along with her Piplup, a small, blue penguin-esque Pok&#233;mon. She wordlessly ran ahead, forcing Shadow and Lucario to run and catch up to her.</p>
<p class='Para'>They both reached the clearing at the same time. "I saw Entei first!" Shadow challenged.</p>
<p class='Para'>"No, I did!" came the retort. "Piplup, use Hydro Pump!" For such a small Pok&#233;mon, Piplup sprayed a huge blast of water at Entei. </p>
<p class='Para'>"Lucario, use Aura Sphere!" Both attacks hit Entei at the same time, but once the steam from the evaporated water cleared, Shadow saw that Entei was completely unfazed. Instead, it used a powerful Flamethrower on them all, forcing them to dodge out of the way.</p>
<p class='Para'>"<i>My </i>Lucario, use Aura Sphere!" Shadow whipped his head around to see that a third Trainer had arrived with a Lucario of his own. However, Entei disdained the attack as well, and retaliated with another Flamethrower, knocking the new Trainer's Lucario against a tree. Entei then bounded away.</p>
<p class='Para'>"You let Entei get away!" Shadow found himself assaulted by the Trainer with the Piplup.</p>
<p class='Para'>"I did?" he replied. "You did!" </p>
<p class='Para'>"Fine! Let's battle! My name is Verity!" </p>
<p class='Para'>"You're on! I'm Shadow!"</p>
<p class='Para'>Looking behind her, she asked the Trainer with a Lucario, "Hey, want to battle me after I wipe the floor with this guy?" </p>
<p class='Para'>"No," he replied coldly and quietly. "I have better things to do. Besides, it's going to rain soon." He walked away via the path he came in from, leaving both Shadow and Verity perplexed; there wasn't a single cloud in the sky.</p>
<p class='Para'>Shadow and Verity maneuvered to opposite sides of the clearing to fight. "I'll give you the first move," Shadow said. </p>
<p class='Para'>"You'll regret that!" Verity returned. "Piplup, use Hydro Pump!" </p>
<p class='Para'>"Lucario, dodge!" As Piplup sprayed a massive cannon of water, Lucario neatly hopped to one side; while it certainly dealt a lot of damage, Hydro Pump wasn't very accurate. The water ended up hitting a mass of rocks behind Shadow. </p>
<p class='Para'>"Lucario, use-" Shadow was interrupted as the ground suddenly began to shake; behind him, the rocks had started moving! Rather than being inanimate stones, it was a 463-pound Onyx that had just been disturbed. Maddened, it began chasing Shadow and Verity, both of which had started running along with their Pok&#233;mon.</p>
<p class='Para'>Ahead of them was a large rock ravine. Shadow couldn't see Onyx behind them, but once they jumped down it burst through the wall directly below them! Shadow and Verity ended up riding Onyx as it coursed through the ravine.</p>
<p class='Para'><i>This can't go on. Here goes!</i> Shadow stood up carefully and walked to the top of Onyx's head. Behind him, Verity warned him to be careful, and he jumped off of Onyx and hit the ground running. Coming to a stop, he called for it to halt so he could explain, but the rock Pok&#233;mon kept moving toward him. </p>
<p class='Para'>"Piplup, use Whirlpool!" Shadow could barely hear Verity over the commotion, but just before Onyx would have run him over a giant swirl of water appeared in front of its head, forcing it to stop.</p>
<p class='Para'>"Onyx, we're sorry," Shadow called. "We didn't mean to scare you; it was an accident."</p>
<p class='Para'>Somehow, Onyx understood and allowed Lucario and Verity to get off before striding off.</p>
<p class='Para'>"I'll admit," Verity said once she had collected herself, "you do some stupid things, but you've got some guts."</p>
<p class='Para'>Shadow abruptly felt something wet fall on his head. Looking up, he saw that clouds had collected. "I guess that Trainer was right," he mumbled.</p>
<p class='Para'>"We'd better find shelter," Verity advised. "Let's look in that forest over there." She pointed toward the opposite side of the ravine.</p>
<p class='Para'>As they clambered up the jagged rocks, rain began to fall harder. Shadow was glad when they made it under the cover of the trees.</p>
<p class='Para'>As they were walking, Verity asked, "Why do you think Entei appeared like that? Legendary Pok&#233;mon are pretty rare."</p>
<p class='Para'>Shadow felt the same way. "Perhaps it was just luck."</p>
<p class='Para'>A quiet sobbing broke their conversation. Off to Shadow's right was a Charmander, sitting on top of a flat rock in a small clearing, looking sickly. Shadow and Verity ran over to help it, and while Shadow moved it into his coat to keep it dry, he asked who put it here.</p>
<p class='Para'>"I did," came the loathsome response. Another Trainer had appeared on the path they were walking on, clad in roughed up clothing and sporting a bright orange hair color. He was accompanied by a Midnight-form Lycanroc, a savage lycanthrope that was native to Alola, a region far away. "That Charmander is weak, and there was no sense keeping it, so I put it out in the rain to tough it up." </p>
<p class='Para'>"<i>What!?</i>&#8221; Shadow screamed, outraged. &#8220;That&#8217;s so irresponsible of you!&#8221; Next to him, Lucario snarled, and Verity echoed his words.</p>
<p class='Para'>&#8220;Whatever. I&#8217;m Cross,&#8221; Cross said, walking away apathetically. Charmander got up and tried to run after him, but it tripped in the mud and fell. Shadow picked it up and protected it from the rain.</p>
<p class='Para'>&#8220;Charmander&#8217;s flame is so small,&#8221; Verity pointed out, &#8220;and if it ever went out completely&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p class='Para'>&#8220;You&#8217;re right,&#8221; Shadow replied. &#8220;We need to find shelter, fast.&#8221;</p>
<p class='Para'>After a couple minutes of brisk walking, the two of them came upon a cave. Stepping inside, Shadow found that a fire was lit, and the Trainer with the Lucario was already inside. The latter jumped down and ran over to Shadow. &#8220;You left it in the rain! How could you?&#8221; </p>
<p class='Para'>&#8220;Relax,&#8221; Verity said. &#8220;It&#8217;s not his fault; someone else left there.&#8221;</p>
<p class='Para'>The Trainer&#8217;s posture changed, and he let out an &#8220;oh&#8221;. &#8220;Follow me. My name&#8217;s Sorrel.&#8221; </p>
<p class='Para'>The fire was situated on a plateau of rock in the cave, opposite another plateau. Sorrel&#8217;s Lucario was sitting there, and when the rest of them made it up, Shadow&#8217;s Lucario immediately walked over, presumably to say hello.</p>
<p class='Para'>Meanwhile, Sorrel took Charmander and placed it on a piece of cloth next to the fire. He then placed a towel soaked with water on its forehead, as well as fed it some herbal medicine.</p>
<p class='Para'>&#8220;You seem to know what you&#8217;re doing,&#8221; Verity commented.</p>
<p class='Para'>&#8220;I&#8217;m trying to become a Pok&#233;mon professor, and knowledge of medicine is necessary for it. Charmander needs to warm up," he concluded.</p>
<p class='Para'>"I'll hold it," Shadow opted, taking it into his arms.</p>
<p class='Para'>The three of them sat down at the three walls present and properly introduced themselves.</p>
<p class='Para'>&#8220;I&#8217;m Shadow, from Pallet Town,&#8221; Shadow began. &#8220;I want to become the world&#8217;s greatest Pok&#233;mon Master!&#8221;</p>
<p class='Para'>Verity laughed. &#8220;I&#8217;m Verity, from Twinleaf Town in the Sinnoh region. It's a long story, but I suppose I'm on a journey, just like you, Shadow."</p>
<p class='Para'>&#8220;I&#8217;m Sorrel, from Veilstone City, also in Sinnoh. Like I said, I want to be a Pok&#233;mon professor; right now I'm studying the Legendary Pok&#233;mon of Kanto."</p>
<p class='Para'>Shadow heard movement in the mouth of the cave and looked over to see that, as if Sorrel&#8217;s words had summoned it, Entei had appeared along with some other wild Pok&#233;mon. The group stared at Entei&mdash;who stared at them back&mdash;as the latter climbed on top of the other rock plateau and rested, the wild Pok&#233;mon falling asleep around it.</p>
<p class='Para'>"Have you heard of the story of the Burned Tower?" Sorrel asked.</p>
<p class='Para'>When both Shadow and Verity shook their heads, he continued: "The Burned Tower was once a tall, prosperous tower located in Ecruteak City. One day, however, lightning struck it and caught it on fire. As it was burning, a storm rolled in and put out the flames, but it was too late; the tower had already collapsed.</p>
<p class='Para'>"Three nameless Pok&#233;mon perished in the fire. It is said that Ho-Oh, the Rainbow Pok&#233;mon, came to the tower<i><b> </i></b>and brought them back to life! The three Pok&#233;mon stood for the forces of nature in this event: Raikou, the lightning that struck the tower; Entei, the flames that engulfed it; and Suicune, the rain that put it out." He reached into his pocket and pulled out a picture. "This is Ho-Oh."</p>
<p class='Para'>Shadow immediately recognized the picture; it was the same rainbow-colored bird he had met on day one!<i><b> </i></b>"I've seen Ho-Oh!" he exclaimed and ran to his coat which had been drying on a clothesline. He pulled out the rainbow-colored wing he had received and showed it off.</p>
<p class='Para'>"Ho-Oh gave you the Rainbow Wing!" Sorrel exclaimed, and Verity let a "wow" escape her. In the background, Entei opened its eyes in surprise.</p>
<p class='Para'>"It's said that Ho-Oh gives the Rainbow Wing to a Trainer it likes, a 'rainbow hero' that is destined to battle it," Sorrel explained. "You should go to the Raizen Mountains; that's where Ho-Oh supposedly resides."</p>
<p class='Para'>"How about we all go?" Verity proposed. "Shadow's the rainbow hero, you said you wanted to study Legendary Pok&#233;mon, and I would love to meet Ho-Oh!"</p>
<p class='Para'>"Okay," Shadow and Sorrel said together, Sorrel adding, "I would love to see if the rainbow hero prophecy is true." </p>
<p class='Para'>A draft suddenly blew in from the mouth of the cave. "It's going to get cold, even with a fire," Sorrel said. "In you go, Lucario." He put his partner into its Pok&#233;ball, and Verity did the same with Piplup.</p>
<p class='Para'>"Oh," Shadow said, "Lucario doesn't appreciate being in its Pok&#233;ball.&#8221;</p>
<p class='Para'>Suddenly Sorrel&#8217;s Lucario and Piplup both appeared from their Pok&#233;balls. Sorrel countered with &#8220;You can&#8217;t; it&#8217;s too dangerous&#8221;, and Verity with &#8220;But you&#8217;ll catch cold&#8221;; but their Pok&#233;mon made it clear they wanted to stay outside of their Pok&#233;balls for the night.</p>
<p class='Para'>Shadow slowly drifted off to sleep, Lucario to his left and Charmander to his right, wondering just what a day he had had.</p>

<p align='justify'><i>&nbsp;</i></p>
<p align='justify'><i>&nbsp;</i></p>
<p align='justify'><i>&nbsp;</i></p>
<p class='Para'>Lucario, who was shouting into his ear. Opening his bleary eyes, he saw that it was morning and that the rain had stopped. Entei was gone as well. Above him, sunlight filtered in through a crack in what was actually a thin ravine, not a cave, like Shadow had thought at first. Around him, Shadow's friends were waking up as well.</p>
<p class='Para'>"How's Charmander's tail flame?" Sorrel asked, getting up and walking over to Shadow. Upon inspecting the small creature, which had been in Shadow's lap the entire night, he said, "It's much bigger. That tells me you're back to full health." Shadow breathed a sigh of relief; the last thing he wanted was for something to happen to the poor thing.</p>
<p class='Para'>As everyone else got up and started preparing to leave the ravine, Shadow kept Charmander close to him. "Hey, Charmander," he said softly. Upon hearing its name, Charmander swiveled its head to look at Shadow, its emerald eyes sparkling in the sunlight. "Would you like to travel with me?"</p>
<p class='Para'>"Char&hellip;." Charmander looked uncertain for a second. "Mander!" it said affirmatively, nodding.</p>
<p class='Para'>"Awesome!" Shadow exclaimed. He took out a Pok&#233;ball from his bag and touched it to Charmander's nose. It disappeared into the Pok&#233;ball for a few seconds and wobbled in Shadow's hand before the device clicked. Shadow took a deep breath, glad that he would be its Trainer.</p>
<p class='Para'>"Come on, Shadow," Verity said as she and Sorrel started heading for an opening in the ravine that was further down. "Do you want to get left behind?" </p>
<p class='Para'>"Coming!" Shadow replied, getting up and joining them.</p>
<p class='Para'>Outside of the cave existed a plateau of rock overlooking a vast forest. The sun shone down brightly, causing everything that still had water on it to shine. Shadow had to duck away to let his eyes accumulate to the light difference.</p>
<p class='Para'>"There's a town near here," Sorrel announced, looking at his map. "Let's head there." </p>
<p class='Para'>Verity took hold of the map for a second before saying, "There's also a waterfall nearby as well. How about we go there and relax before heading into town?" </p>
<p class='Para'>"Sounds good to me," Shadow added. </p>
<p class='Para'>The three of them and their Pok&#233;mon traveled down the plateau onto the ground below via a steep rocky path to the left. Luckily, no one fell, and in good time they were all at the bottom. Verity led the way, using the map as a reference, until they made it to their destination: On another face of the mountain they were just in, water flowed down into a medium-sized pool, shrouded by trees and complemented by a clearing.</p>
<p class='Para'>Shadow, Verity, and their Pok&#233;mon wasted no time jumping in to refresh, while Sorrel and his Lucario stayed dry, sitting against a tree in the middle of the clearing. This went on for a while until they grew tired of swimming, after which they dried off and changed into their regular clothes. </p>
<p class='Para'>Once they were all situated, Shadow looked around and spotted movement in a nearby bush. Walking over to check it out, he saw that a Pinsir&mdash;a giant, beetle-like Pok&#233;mon that was as tall as Shadow&mdash;was foraging. <i>Let's get some battle practice in!</i> "Caterpie, let's go!" He threw the Bug-type Pok&#233;mon's Pok&#233;ball onto the ground, where the inside creature appeared in a brilliant flash of light. </p>
<p class='Para'>Meanwhile, the Pinsir took notice of Shadow and moved into a battle position.</p>
<p class='Para'>"Use String Shot!" Small threads flew out of Caterpie's mouth and wrapped around Pinsir, disabling it from moving.</p>
<p class='Para'>Before Shadow could give another command, however, Caterpie began glowing white, just like Lucario had when it evolved. It changed shape into a more banana-like form by the end of its evolution, and when color returned to it, was colored completely green and had two white eyes. Shadow recognized it as Metapod, the cocoon stage in a Caterpie's life cycle.</p>
<p class='Para'>As Shadow picked up Metapod to hug it, he saw the Pinsir break free and walk away in his peripherals. "Don't you want to catch Pinsir?" Verity queried.</p>
<p class='Para'>"Nah," Shadow replied. "Caterpie&mdash;I mean Metapod&mdash;evolved."</p>
<p class='Para'>"I think that's a good way to wrap up our stay here," Sorrel added. "Let's get going to the town."</p>
<p class='Para'>"Right," Shadow and Verity said in unison.</p>
<p class='Para'>The three of them set off, Sorrel now leading them, and they made it to the entrance in good time&mdash;luckily for them, the waterfall wasn't too much of a detour.</p>
<p class='Para'>As soon as Shadow entered he spotted a battlefield where several other trainers were fighting each other. He said a hasty farewell to Verity and Sorrel and ran over there with Lucario. The next thing he knew, he was in a battle with someone else, using Charmander against a Jigglypuff&mdash;a small, pink-colored Pok&#233;mon.</p>
<p class='Para'>"Charmander, use Ember!" Charmander spewed a blast of hot fire from its mouth that directly hit Jigglypuff, knocking it over. "Follow up with Scratch!" Charmander rushed over to deliver blows from its tiny claws, but Jigglypuff's Trainer had something else in mind. </p>
<p class='Para'>"Use Sing!" she said melodically, prompting Jigglypuff to get up and, well, sing. Shadow was dumbfounded as Charmander fell over while running, fast asleep. "Now that Charmander's asleep, use Pound," she commanded in a cutesy tone.</p>
<p class='Para'>"Charmander! Wake up!" Shadow shouted as his Pok&#233;mon was then subjected to repeated slaps, but it was to no avail. Jigglypuff finished its barrage with a powerful smack that sent Charmander flying back towards Shadow, landing a few feet in front of him. Thankfully, that seemed to awaken it; Charmander opened its eyes and immediately stood up again, albeit wobbly from the damage.</p>
<p class='Para'>"Your Charmander's tenacious, I'll give it that much," Shadow's opponent taunted, "but I'm afraid that its time has run out. Jigglypuff, use Sing again!"</p>
<p class='Para'>Before Jigglypuff could possibly have done anything, Shadow retorted with "Cover your ears!" Charmander did as instructed, and to Shadow's satisfaction, it wasn't affected. "Now, it's time to finish this battle. Use Ember again!" Jigglypuff was prepared this time and jumped out of the way of the fireball, but Charmander unexpectedly fired another Ember that did hit it. When the smoke cleared, Jigglypuff was lying on the ground, fainted.</p>
<p class='Para'>"Charmander, you did it!" Shadow said as his friend began running towards him. His celebration was cut short, however, when Charmander suddenly began to evolve on the way back. Still running, it grew into a bigger size of itself, and when the process was complete it was revealed to be colored entirely red now. "I mean, Charmeleon, you did it!" The two of them hugged for a few moments before Shadow got up. "That was a good battle," he called across to his opponent, who had returned her Jigglypuff to its Pok&#233;ball. She gave him a slight nod before the two of them walked away from the battlefield to let other Trainers fight.</p>
<p class='Para'>Satisfied with how the day had gone&mdash;two of his Pok&#233;mon had evolved&mdash;Shadow retired for the rest of the day. He met up with Sorrel and Verity at a hotel, where the three instantly resigned to their beds and slept until morning.</p>
<p class='Para'>No later than the sun had risen did the three of them rise. Sorrel led them to the local library where they all sat down in a corner on the upper floor. Sorrel pulled out a book that appeared to be disused; a layer of dust existed on it.</p>
<p class='Para'>"This book is expertly well maintained and researched," Sorrel said as he flipped through the pages. "According to it, long ago, Ho-Oh watched over the works of people and Pok&#233;mon alike, and everyone was given an aura of energy and happiness. However, a heart of evil touched the Rainbow Wing, and its color vanished."</p>
<p class='Para'>"You might make some dumb decisions," Verity remarked, "but I don't think you have a heart of evil." They all chuckled a little; after all, it was true.</p>
<p class='Para'>"Hey, let's go to the battlefield," Sorrel suggested. "Lucario and I are itching to battle!" </p>
<p class='Para'>"Alright," Verity said. </p>
<p class='Para'>Sorrel put the book back. Shadow could have sworn he heard hurried footsteps going away from them as they headed downstairs and to the outdoors. The battlefield was just a few buildings away, so they were there in no time. Once they arrived, they agreed Shadow should go first, and he went on to battle another Trainer's Snorlax&mdash;a giant glutton Pok&#233;mon that weighed half a ton.</p>
<p class='Para'>"You're up, Lucario," Shadow enthusiastically announced. "It's time for a real battle." He mentally readied himself, then shouted out, "Lucario, use Aura Sphere!" Shadow's partner launched a teal sphere across the battlefield that directly hit Snorlax; as Shadow expected, it didn't have the mobility to evade most attacks. However, what it lacked in speed it made for in endurance; it seemed completely unfazed. <i>Then we'll just have to work harder.</i></p>
<p class='Para'>It was time for Snorlax's trainer to make a move. "Snorlax, use Body Slam!" Shadow was amazed to see Snorlax moving faster than at a snail's pace towards Lucario. It jumped high into the air and started falling on its opponent.</p>
<p class='Para'>"Lucario, use Extreme Speed and get out of the way!" A thin white aura enveloped Lucario and it ran away from Snorlax, leaving a blazing white trail after it. "Then use Force Palm!" Snorlax landed with a thud, prompting Lucario to take full advantage and drill a Force Palm into it.</p>
<p class='Para'>"Use Chip Away!" the other Trainer announced. Snorlax went on the offensive, leaving Lucario blocking rapid attacks until one of them struck, sending it skidding back. "Now use Body Slam again!" As Lucario was still recovering, Snorlax leaped into the air once again and began descending directly on Lucario. </p>
<p class='Para'>There was no time for Lucario to use Extreme Speed this time. "Use, er, Bone Rush!" Shadow called uncertainly. Lucario put its paws together above its head and a teal-colored bone made of Aura appeared as it spread them. As Snorlax crashed down on it, it swung up, but Snorlax hit the ground anyway, sending dust flying.</p>
<p class='Para'>Shadow feared the worst, but he saw Snorlax budge, and it suddenly was swung back into the air, revealing Lucario with its Bone Rush in hand underneath, unharmed. Snorlax landed on the ground hard, and when another plume of dust settled, it was fainted.</p>
<p class='Para'>"That was an impressive battle," Sorrel admitted as Lucario returned to stand beside Shadow. </p>
<p class='Para'>"Yeah," Verity added. "How about you and me battle, Piplup?" she asked the small penguin, who was sitting in her lap.</p>
<p class='Para'>"<i>I'll </i>battle you next." Shadow swung around his head to see Cross appearing from the crowd along with his Lycanroc and immediately tensed. "I heard a rumor that you started using that Charmander."</p>
<p class='Para'>Shadow prickled with indignation. Trying to prove Cross wrong, he sent Charm<i>eleon</i> to face up against him, whose jaw immediately dropped when it saw who it was battling.</p>
<p class='Para'>"Oh, the weakling evolved? Whatever. Weak Pok&#233;mon that evolve are still weak," Cross maintained.</p>
<p class='Para'>"I'm sure I'll win," Shadow said under his breath. "I'm up against incorrectly trained Pok&#233;mon. You're on!" he challenged, raising his voice.</p>
<p class='Para'>"Alright." Cross threw a Pok&#233;ball at the ground that unleashed what Shadow identified as Incineroar&mdash;a giant wrestler-esque cat that was also native to the Alola region.</p>
<p class='Para'>Shadow refused to let Cross go first, and immediately shouted, "Charmeleon, use Scratch!" Charmeleon dutifully ran across and swiped at Incineroar, who took the attack without even flinching. When it didn't retaliate, Shadow said, "Follow up with Flamethrower, and then Scratch again!" Again, Incinceroar barely moved as it was doused in flames and then scratched once more.</p>
<p class='Para'>Then something changed in Incineroar; its eyes widened as if it were finally waking up and it let out a menacing growl.</p>
<p class='Para'>Cross smiled faintly before commanding, "Use Flamethrower!" The ensuing mass of flames that flared out from Incineroar's mouth made Charmeleon's Flamethrower look like nothing, and the latter was immediately burned and sent flying back.</p>
<p class='Para'>"I see," Sorrel said next to Verity. "Cross is using Incineroar's ability, Rage, which makes it do more damage when it's low on health."</p>
<p class='Para'>"Charmeleon, can you still battle?" Shadow called. When it got back up, his confidence returned. "Alright, use Flamethrower again!" Charmeleon took a deep breath, but instead of spewing fire, all that came out of its mouth was smoke.</p>
<p class='Para'>Cross took advantage. "Use Fire Fang!" Defenseless, Charmeleon faced the full front of the attack: a flame shaped like teeth that chomped down on it and knocked it back far enough for it to slam into the wall behind Shadow. When Charmeleon fell off of it, there was a deep indent.</p>
<p class='Para'>"Charmeleon has only just evolved," Sorrel realized. "It hasn't had the time to adjust to its new powers yet."</p>
<p class='Para'>"Ch-Charmeleon?" Shadow asked, unsure if it could continue. However, it stood standing where it was, willing to fight to the end. "That's the spirit," he called, still believing he could win. <i>This has to work!</i> "Use Flamethrower!"</p>
<p class='Para'>"Shadow, no!" Sorrel instantly exclaimed, but it was too late: Charmeleon coughed smoke yet again, and Cross yelled, "Use Cross Chop!" Incineroar put its arms together in the shape of an X and struck Charmeleon them with them, knocking it back into the wall that it had just come from. A piece of the top of the wall broke off, and Charmeleon lay crumpled just after it. It attempted to lift its head, but couldn't; it was defeated.</p>
<p class='Para'>"Hmph," Cross said as he returned Incineroar to its Pok&#233;ball. "You relied on cheap friendship and tried to use moves you couldn't use. You're the worst Trainer I've ever seen."</p>
<p class='Para'>Shadow opened his mouth, but no words came out, and Cross stalked away. The crowd that had gathered to watch the battle walked away, and for the first time, Shadow realized that it was nighttime. He wordlessly returned Charmeleon to its Pok&#233;ball and walked back to Sorrel and Verity, who stood next to a nearby Pok&#233;mon Center. The local Nurse Joy healed his Pok&#233;mon for him, and the three of them walked back outside after a "thank you very much".</p>
<p class='Para'>"I should have won that battle," Shadow said morosely.</p>
<p class='Para'>"However wrong Cross' training methods are, you can't ignore that he and Incineroar strongly believe in them," Sorrel returned.</p>
<p class='Para'>"Yeah, but&hellip;" Shadow slowly walked in a circle, staring at Charmeleon's Pok&#233;ball. "You know&hellip; If I had used Lucario, I would have won."</p>
<p class='Para'>"Shadow, don't say that!" Verity said. "Charmeleon might have heard you."</p>
<p class='Para'>"If that's all you can think about, then you're no better than Cross," Sorrel retorted.</p>
<p class='Para'>Shadow verged on the edge of tears. <i>What did I just say?</i> He broke out running for the forest that lay beyond the still-broken wall, the rest of the group chasing after him and calling him back. Sorrel and Verity were quickly left behind, but Lucario managed to keep pace with him. Eventually, he slowed down to a walk, now deep within the forest.</p>
<p class='Para'>"What a bunch of losers," he said aloud. "Don't you agree with me, Lucario?" When it shook its head, he couldn't believe it. "Even you. I wish I had chosen a Bulbasaur or a Squirtle instead." Shadow stopped hearing footsteps behind him and turned around to see it standing in one place. Determined to make a point, he kept walking away. When he looked back a second time, it was gone. "Lucario?" he called.</p>
<p class='Para'>He sat down against a nearby tree. "Do I even need Lucario?" he asked himself. Taking out the Rainbow Wing, he called aloud, "Ho-Oh, I thought <i>I</i> was the rainbow hero."</p>
<p class='Para'>As Shadow sat and looked around, realizing that he was in the middle of the wilderness, he thought he heard a rustle behind him. Before he could turn his head, exhaustion overcame him, as if something was willing to sleep. The last thing he saw before he closed his eyes was the Rainbow Wing drifting out of his hand, losing its color.</p>

<p align='justify'><i>&nbsp;</i></p>
<p class='Para'><i><b>"I'm going so fast!"</i></b></p>
<p class='Para'><i><b>Shadow shifted </i></b>his race car into sixth gear, speeding by on the tarmac raceway. <i>I'm so close to finishing in first</i>, he thought. Looking in his mirrors, he saw his opponents beginning to catch up to them, and adrenaline started pumping through his body. <i>Almost there! </i>The white checkered flag was just within reach.</p>
<p class='Para'>Suddenly, Shadow's vision changed. Instead of being in an intense race, he was lying in his bed in his messy, cluttered room; it was all just a dream. Sunlight was poking through the blinds on his window, indicating that it the day was already well underway. Across his room, he saw the remains of his car-shaped alarm clock; it looked like someone had thrown it.</p>
<p class='Para'>Shadow was still in the midst waking up, but once he realized what had happened, his mind snapped awake as he screamed aloud, "I'm late to the first day of school!"</p>
<p class='Para'>Opening his dresser to put on his regular clothes and taking a moment to appreciate a poster of his dream cars&mdash;three sleek, black stylistic vehicles&mdash;Shadow dashed out of his bedroom and down the stairs of the two-story house to the living room where his dad was already awake. Flabbergasted, Shadow asked him, "Why didn't you wake me up?" </p>
<p class='Para'>"I forgot," came the lame response.</p>
<p class='Para'>"Well, at least the school is close by." Shadow dashed out of the door and ran over to school in record time, despite the school being located at the top of a hill. Outside it was a teacher whom Shadow recognized as Professor Oak, watering some bushes outside the the tall, white building.</p>
<p class='Para'>"Oh, hello, Shadow," Oak called once he saw him. "Out of the four students that were late, you were the latest."</p>
<p class='Para'>Shadow groaned inwardly and headed straight to class. Once he arrived and found a seat, he learned that the class was studying rainbows.</p>
<p class='Para'>"Shadow, you're late!" Shadow heard Verity, his classmate and close friend, tell him. Another friend, Sorrel, also commented, "Did you forget your homework again?" Shadow wished he could sink into the floor.</p>
<p class='Para'>As the lecture trudged on, Shadow felt that something was missing from him. The color blue suddenly blurred under his desk, but he saw nothing when he looked under it.</p>
<p class='Para'>"What are you looking at?" Verity asked. </p>
<p class='Para'>"Oh, nothing," Shadow responded; it must have been his imagination.</p>
<p class='Para'>"You're weird," Sorrel said, Verity agreeing.</p>
<p class='Para'>Something outside the classroom caught Shadow's attention. Trying to focus on it, he thought he was seeing a giant rainbow-colored bird in the sky, but after rubbing his eyes it was just a plane.</p>
<p class='Para'>Once the lesson ended, Shadow headed straight to the rooftop, where grey floors met chain link fences. He looked out over the nearby forest and past the town beyond it, staring at the horizon, until he heard footsteps. Turning his head around, he saw Verity and Sorrel approaching him.</p>
<p class='Para'>"Do you ever get bored of the view?" Verity asked.</p>
<p class='Para'>"What do you think is out there; beyond the school?" Shadow returned, changing the subject.</p>
<p class='Para'>"Well," Sorrel began, "there's forest, and then a town, and then more forest and another town. Beyond that would be the sea." </p>
<p class='Para'>"After that?"</p>
<p class='Para'>"It's just more of the same," Verity replied.</p>
<p class='Para'>"I want to go and explore what's out there," Shadow said on a tangent. </p>
<p class='Para'>"That would be nice," Sorrel responded. </p>
<p class='Para'>"Yeah," Verity chimed in. "No school, you get to stay up as late as you want&hellip;you get absolute freedom."</p>
<p class='Para'>"Yeah," Shadow said, "and I always have my buddy&mdash;Oh," he stopped himself when he realized that his buddy no longer existed. Something blue flickered next to him for an instant and prompted him to start crying.</p>
<p class='Para'>"Shadow, are you okay?" Verity asked, Sorrel saying, "Pull yourself together!"</p>
<p class='Para'>Shadow looked up to reply, but he saw that they were gone; he was alone. Behind him, he heard something, and turned to see that same blue, hazy figure, standing and waving at him, though he couldn't make out what it was. He began running toward it, and was immediately amazed to see that the entire landscape changed to that of a town plaza. </p>
<p class='Para'>"Ha," he said weakly as he kept running toward the image, who had begun running away from him. "We used to run like this all the time." </p>
<p class='Para'>Suddenly, the ground started crumbling to pieces, as if reality itself was being torn. Ahead of him nothing but floating cubes of terrain existed. "Wait! Don't go!" he shouted desperately as he began parkouring on the cubes. The figure was very close now. <i>Just a little more&hellip;</i> Shadow jumped for it. What seemed like eternity to him elapsed before he connected with it.</p>
<p class='Para'>"Lucario!" Shadow shouted, remembering its name. He closed his eyes in comfort, but when he opened them again he found himself and Lucario high in the sky, atop a meadow. Shadow's heart jumped to his mouth as the two of them began falling. Shadow braced for impact as they neared the ground. It never came.</p>
<p class='Para'>Shadow opened his eyes and found himself in the waking world where he was before he fell asleep; the entire thing had been one big dream. His surroundings began coming back to him; the tree he was sitting against, the forest he was in&hellip;and then he looked ahead and saw Lucario staring back at him, repeating "Carr" nervously.</p>
<p class='Para'>Shadow jumped forward and hugged Lucario tight, crying profusely. "I'm so sorry; it was all my fault."</p>
<p class='Para'>He looked around and saw Verity and Sorrel standing to the right and left of him, respectively. Verity reached down and picked something up, and handed it to Shadow. It was the Rainbow Wing; full of color again. "I think you dropped this," she said jokingly. </p>
<p class='Para'>Shadow graciously accepted it before Verity's tone made a U-turn. "Do you have any idea how long we've been searching for you?" </p>
<p class='Para'>"You cannot expect to win every battle," Sorrel lectured. "It's the losses you grow strong from&hellip;but that's just my opinion. Come on, let's go somewhere else in this forest."</p>

<p class='Para'>The group makes a fire in a circular clearing of trees; a thin fog has rolled in, and it is still nighttime. Shadow is explaining the dream that he had, the others listening in closely. Verity is in shock at the very concept of a world without Pok&#233;mon. Sorrel, on the other hand, has a different perspective: it is possible for Pok&#233;mon to leave us. He describes a time in his early childhood: His parents were away most of the time, so the family Luxray took care of Sorrel. One day, however, Sorrel hurt himself outside in a blizzard and quickly started freezing. Luxray bounded across and laid down with him in the center to keep him from doing so. In the morning, when the blizzard was gone, Luxray was frozen solid; it had died smiling. A rescue team found Sorrel with Luxray, and as they carried him away, he screamed his protector&#8217;s name. Afterwards, Sorrel was reluctant to make friends with any Pok&#233;mon, until he found Lucario. Shadow and Verity are somber after hearing the tale and offer their condolences. Meanwhile, Marshadow slowly appears from Shadow&#8217;s shadow, but this time they spot it. Lucario is instantly aggressive and fires an Aura Sphere at Marshadow&#8217;s location, but it rescinds long before it would have hit. Instead, the Aura Sphere hits the tree and shakes it. A group of Primape come down from the branches and quickly gather the team in a circle, repeatedly launching them in the air. Sorrel advises Shadow to use Metapod, as fighting back would only make them madder. Shadow manages to dismount the circle of Primape and takes out Metapod; he holds it and has it use String Shot, running around the ring. The aggressors are ensnared, and everyone dismounts before they can attack again. While running, Metapod evolves into Butterfree. Shadow has it use Sleep Powder on the Primape, who had broken out of the String Shot, and they all fall asleep. The group then continues walking, no longer threatened. They quickly reach a stream, and Verity gets out her Lapras. They all board Lapras and begin sailing downstream.</p>

<p class='Para'>The group is still going downstream on Lapras&#8217; back when day breaks, but they eventually disembark and continue walking. As they are going through a forest and are about to reach a cliff, however, they hear a Pok&#233;mon scream off to the left. After looking, they identify it as a pink Butterfree who is being hunted by a Fearow. Shadow immediately goes to protect it, unleashing his own Butterfree and having it chase the Fearow away with Gust. When the belligerent flees, the two Butterfree stop for a second, the pink one thanking the other. Sorrel points out that the pink one is pink, as opposed to blue, and Verity concludes that it must be female. The pink Butterfree flies off. Once they are at the edge of the cliff, the Rainbow Wing begins glowing. Shadow takes it out of his pocket, and it lights a visible beam all the way to a mountain that isn&#8217;t too far away: Mount Tensei. They&#8217;re in front of another cliff when Shadow spots a swarm of Butterfree flying together in the distance. Sorrel comments that it&#8217;s mating season for the Butterfree right now. Shadow takes out his own Butterfree, and within a few seconds, the pink one from before flies down to greet them. Shadow encourages their relationship, saying that they are awesome together, but Verity warns that should the two Butterfree go off together, it would be goodbye. Shadow becomes distraught at the concept of saying goodbye, and Sorrel states that in the end, it is his decision. Butterfree itself flies down to Shadow, who asks it if it wants to go. Butterfree responds after hesitation by flying behind his back. Shadow says that it should go with the other Butterfree and that if they don&#8217;t go now, they will be left behind (in the background, the Butterfree swarm has continued flying some distance). As his Butterfree goes to be with the pink one, Shadow praises them, saying that they are both really great Pok&#233;mon (with a slight pause between &#8220;both&#8221; and &#8220;really&#8221;). As they begin waving goodbye to each other, Shadow and Butterfree both start crying profusely. They continue until the swarm has left; long after the sun has set. Shadow says that he is glad to have met Butterfree and that even though it&#8217;s not here, they are still good friends. Sorrel comments that though people raise Pok&#233;mon, Pok&#233;mon live their own lives. Suddenly, a bolt of lightning crashes down behind the group. Turning around, they witness Raikou, the third of the legendary trio, standing on top of a rock looking down at them. With another flash of lightning, Raikou is gone as soon as it appeared. Their resolve strengthened, the group pushes forward to reach Mount Tensei.</p>

<p class='Para'>The group is at the base of Mount Tensei, walking along through thick fog. Many Pok&#233;mon are scattered about, looking agitated, and Verity comments about it. Bonji suddenly says that it&#8217;s because they want to meet Ho-Oh and receive its power. Bonji gets down from the rock he was on and starts sniffing the air, catching a faint scent of Ho-Oh. Shadow pulls out the Rainbow Wing, and Bonji is amazed. Verity is surprised that he knows of it, and Sorrel recognizes him as being the author of the book in the library. Bonji says his name, explaining that for the past 20 years he&#8217;s been on a quest, searching for Ho-Oh being a part of his research. He elaborates that he&#8217;s pulled data from many places and that the data all shows Mount Tensei to be the place of Ho-Oh&#8217;s next appearance. They agree to travel together to the summit, and Bonji comments that the Rainbow Wing&#8217;s shine is the shine of youth and that it&#8217;s almost too beautiful for him to look upon. As they are walking, Bonji says that it&#8217;s probably thanks in large part to the Rainbow Wing that the group has come across Entei, Raikou, and Suicune. He goes on to say that Ho-Oh wants to know if there is a young person suitable enough to be the Rainbow Hero, which means that there may be someone guiding Shadow from the shadows. Shadow recalls seeing one, and Bonji says that it&#8217;s most likely the extremely rare Pok&#233;mon Marshadow. Marshadow is a guide from the shadows, and that when the Rainbow Wing&#8217;s color fades, it seals it back up and makes it right. The fog has been getting thinner as they&#8217;ve been walking uphill, and suddenly the Rainbow Wing glows; when Shadow takes it out, it lights a direct beam of light to a crystal rock at the summit. Bonji prophesizes that when a Rainbow Flower blooms upon Rainbow Rock, Ho-Oh shall appear, and Shadow is overexcited, running ahead.</p>

<br /><br /><br /><center>* * *</center><br /><br />

<p class='Para'>When the group makes it to the summit, they find that more Pok&#233;mon are standing on ledges, waiting. There is a circular area fit for a battlefield, and in front of them is Rainbow Rock. Sorrel says that that&#8217;s where Shadow should place the Rainbow Wing, and the latter runs over to plant it. However, Incineroar stops him, using Throat Chop in front of him to knock him back. Cross appears from behind the rock and demands the Rainbow Wing, saying that the Trainer who gets to battle Ho-Oh is the strongest and that he is said person. Sorrel defies that, saying that that&#8217;s not how it works, and Verity chimes in, saying that the one to battle Ho-Oh is the one chosen by it. Cross calls them soft, using the jingle &#8220;might makes right, and that&#8217;s it&#8221;. Answering Shadow&#8217;s questions, he declares weak people trash, and people that lose worse than trash. The Rainbow Wing suddenly glows, and Marshadow appears from Shadow&#8217;s shadow and jumps on top of a ledge. Shadow recognizes it as being Marshadow; Cross is satisfied to meet the guardian from the shadow; Sorrel says that it&#8217;s the Pok&#233;mon they saw that night; and Verity declares it cute. Bonji says that its only purpose is to observe the proceedings.</p>

<p class='Para'>Shadow releases Charmeleon from its Pok&#233;ball to battle Cross&#8217; Incineroar. The latter immediately starts with Flamethrower, which Charmeleon dodges. Charmeleon retaliates with Slash, which lands a direct hit. Incineroar uses Throat Chop, and Charmeleon hops around unharmed. Charmeleon uses Slash yet again, and the two are locked in a power contest. Incineroar then uses Flamethrower, and Charmeleon is caught directly, blocking the flames. While in the Flamethrower, however, it evolves into Charizard. Cross doesn&#8217;t care, saying that weak Pok&#233;mon who evolve are still weak. He continues with Throat Chop, and Charizard uses Slash; they end up hitting each other. Incineroar uses Flamethrower, and Charizard flies around to dodge it. Charizard uses Dragon Rage, and it&#8217;s a direct hit. Shadow commands Charizard to build up its power to end it with a big attack. Incineroar continues the onslaught with Fire Fang, and Charizard dodges. While it's in the air, Incineroar jumps and grabs it to bring it down. Before it hits the ground, Charizard uses Seismic Toss and flings Incineroar across the stage. Cross aims to end the fight with Flamethrower; Charizard does the same. It&#8217;s a fire contest, but Charizard&#8217;s flame powers into a fully-fledged fireball and Incineroar loses, unable to battle. Cross gets on his knees and returns Incineroar. Shadow takes out the Rainbow Wing and walks over to the Rainbow Walk, but after he walks by Cross, the latter says that he saw Ho-Oh too. Cross continues, saying that it didn&#8217;t give him the Rainbow Wing even after he&#8217;s done everything to become the strongest. He asks why it had to be Shadow, and that if Ho-Oh doesn&#8217;t consider him the strongest, he&#8217;ll crush it. Shadow intervenes, saying that he wants to get stronger as well, but explains that he only got this far with the help of his friends, so he knows that it&#8217;s not just about strength. Cross asks him what he even battles for, and Shadow responds that it&#8217;s because he wants to make friends. Cross doesn&#8217;t reply, instead running at Shadow and wrestling the Rainbow Wing away from him. He climbs up to the top of Rainbow Rock, the Rainbow Wing losing its color as he holds it, and places it where it should be. A dark beam appears from Rainbow Rock and clouds flood the sky. The ground turns corrupt and purple as well. Bonji comments that the Rainbow Wing loses its color when touched by one with an evil heart. Marshadow appears from the shadows and grabs Cross, tossing him aside; Lycanroc catches him. Bonji nervously repeats that Marshadow seals it back up and makes it right.</p>

<p class='Para'>Cross vows to pound Marshadow as well as he recovers from being thrown. Lycanroc uses Crush Claw, but before it makes it Marshadow fires a beam of darkness towards it; Lycanroc&#8217;s eyes turn purple, and it turns around, mind-controlled. It starts attacking Cross, who runs away from it. Just before a ball of energy hits Cross, Charizard flies in front of him, taking the blow. Verity asks if he sees it now that Charizard never forgot that he was once its trainer. Shadow comments that it&#8217;s just like Charizard to be awesome. Meanwhile, Marshadow fires more dark beams of light all around, mind-controlling every Pok&#233;mon around except for the group&#8217;s. An Electabuzz fires a Thunderbolt towards Cross and Charizard&mdash;the two jump away in response&mdash;and a Pidgeotto flies towards Bonji, Sorrel, and Shadow; Sorrel&#8217;s Lucario knocks it away. Bonji says that it looks as if Marshadow wants to control the group as well and that Ho-Oh will never appear now that it&#8217;s come to this. At Marshadow&#8217;s command, a group of Pok&#233;mon fire attacks at the group, forcing them to retreat. Bonji says that Shadow has got to get the Rainbow Wing back; Marshadow is getting its power from it, and only Shadow can get it back. Sorrel and Verity help defend Shadow while the latter starts making his way to Marshadow. Charizard Flamethrowers a Graveller and Magmar; Piplup uses Hydro Pump against a Pidgeotto; Charizard body slams an Arbok; Shadow runs on top of a charging Ryhorn; Sorrel&#8217;s Lucario uses Bone Rush to block a Graveller as well as the Ryhorn; and just before it fires a Stone Edge, Cross tackles Lycanroc, pinning it down. Lycanroc proceeds to bite Cross&#8217; arm; Cross remembers that it bit him the day they met as well. He commands Lycanroc to remember as well, and it snaps out of its trance. Shadow makes it to Marshadow and demands that it give him the Rainbow Wing; it responds by leaping down from the rock and firing dark balls of energy at Lucario. Lucario retaliates by dodging the first two and hitting the third one back with a Bone Rush; Marshadow deflects it. The two engage in close combat, Lucario still having a Bone Rush, but Marshadow lands a blow, and Lucario is knocked back. Behind the two, Sorrel&#8217;s Lucario is hit, but before the opposing Pok&#233;mon can do more damage Cross steps in with Lycanroc and counters an incoming fireball. However, a Nidoqueen and Nidoking both use Rock Throw, attacking the party with boulders. The defenders run away to avoid getting crushed. An Arbok wraps around Charizard&#8217;s neck, incapacitating it. Meanwhile, Lucario is hit again with one of Marshadow&#8217;s attacks, but Shadow is anything but deterred; Lucario keeps fighting. Marshadow begins glowing, its previously grey hair and eyebrows becoming green and red, respectively, and unleashes a flurry of energy balls. Lucario attempts to dodge them but is hit by one and subsequently all the others. Shadow responds immediately by having Lucario use Aura Sphere mid-air; Marshadow jumps in a kicking position. It is a power standoff, but Marshadow wins, and Lucario is directly hit. An explosion occurs from the energy exertion, knocking both Shadow and the rest of the party back.</p>

<p class='Para'>Shadow immediately gets back up to see Lucario lying on the ground a few feet away and runs toward it; while he does so, Marshadow stops glowing and stumbles for a second. As Shadow crouches down, he sees that the mind-controlled Pok&#233;mon are advancing on him; he picks up Lucario and runs away from them until he reaches the edge of a ledge. Turning back, he sees his opponents all lines up, ready to strike. Shadow attempts to run away, but the Nidoqueen fires a Flamethrower at him and hits him directly. The others try to advance and defend him but are suppressed by other enslaved Pok&#233;mon; Shadow is all on his own. When the dust from the impact clears, Shadow is on the ground a few feet away from Lucario; the two begin crawling towards each other. Out of the corner of his eye, he sees the other Pok&#233;mon continuing to encroach, and takes Lucario&#8217;s Pok&#233;ball and rolls it over to it, pleading for it to get inside. He says that he knows it can&#8217;t stand being inside Pok&#233;balls, but it would be protected. The other Pok&#233;mon start charging an attack, and Shadow stands up to face them. He turns his cap around and says with perfect clarity, &#8220;Now you look. I don&#8217;t think you know who you&#8217;re dealing with. I&#8217;m Shadow, from Pallet Town, and I&#8217;m gonna be the world&#8217;s&#8230;greatest Pok&#233;mon master! Mess with me, and you&#8217;re gonna lose!&#8221; Immediately as he says the last word the Pok&#233;mon fire, and Lucario runs to protect him. Shadow sees this and stops it, instead burying it in his arms to protect it. He lets out a scream as the blast hits, and he is knocked to the ground, Lucario next to him. He asks why Lucario won&#8217;t get in its Pok&#233;ball, and his partner replies in English, &#8220;It&#8217;s because&#8230;It&#8217;s because I always want&#8230;to be with you.&#8221; The other Pok&#233;mon charge one final shot, and Shadow forces Lucario into its Pok&#233;ball. Holding the Pok&#233;ball tightly to his chest, Shadow is hit by the attack. An explosion ensues, so great that it is visible from several mountains away. The rest of the party including Cross gathers to watch, and Charizard flings the Arbok off its neck. When the smoke clears, Lucario&#8217;s Pok&#233;ball rolls away, and Shadow&#8217;s hat lands on top of it. When Lucario comes out of the Pok&#233;ball, the hat is on top of it. In front of it is Shadow&#8217;s body, transparent with pure energy irradiating from it. The Rainbow Wing begins to disintegrate in Marshadow&#8217;s hand. Lucario takes the hat and attempts to place it on Shadow&#8217;s head, but as it puts it down the body fades away into nothingness; the Rainbow Wing completely disintegrates as well. When the last sparkles have disappeared, Lucario takes the hat and buries it in its face, crying out. A massive blast of Aura engulfs everything on top of the mountain; it is so strong that the clouds fade and reveal a blue sky. When the smoke disappears, the opposing Pok&#233;mon are no longer mind-controlled. Everybody focuses on Lucario, who is crying into the hat. It lets out a shout that reaches into the heavens.</p>

<p class='Para'>Shadow awakens where the final blast hit him, but one thing is severely different: the entire world, himself included, is grayscale. He gets up and asks where everybody is. He hears Lucario crying behind him and turns around. He takes a step in its direction, and suddenly the entire world changes: he is now standing in a color-filled grassy plain at sunset, though he himself is still greyscaled. In the waking world, particles begin to gather where Shadow&#146;s body was. Shadow hears Lucario again and starts running in its direction; the landscape changes again, the sky now being grey and the ground now being an endless grass plain. There are more particles where Shadow&#146;s body was, and they begin to move around more actively. As Shadow is running, he chuckles a little, commenting that they used to run like this all the time. The plain is suddenly filled with flowers as a small beam of light opens amid the particles. As Shadow continues running the sky changes to a blue color, and he starts running on top of water. The particles become more fantastic, and the beam enlarges to create a portal; Lucario drops the hat as it stares in amazement. Shadow is now running through a rainbow of colors as Lucario jumps into the portal; it appears in the sky in Shadow&#146;s reality as Shadow returns to running on water. Shadow jumps to meet Lucario and the two hug mid-air; once they connect Shadow&#146;s body becomes color again. The light in the waking world becomes dazzlingly bright, and when it fades, Shadow is alive, standing with Lucario. Verity and Sorrel run over to meet Shadow, and Sorrel comments that he&#146;s alright. Charizard also lets out a yell. Suddenly, particles begin gathering in Shadow&#146;s hand, and the Rainbow Wing reforms; the Rainbow Rock, as well as the floor, also return to a normal color. Bonji repeats that when a Rainbow Flower blooms on Rainbow Rock, Ho-Oh shall appear, and urges Shadow onward. Shadow climbs to the top of Rainbow Rock and deposits the feather; when he does so a brief flash of rainbow-colored light beams into the sky and a rainbow forms, Rainbow Rock being one of its bases. On the other end of the rainbow, Ho-Oh is flying towards them. Bonji continues speaking, now saying that the one who is guided by the Rainbow Wing may meet Ho-Oh and become the rainbow hero. Ho-Oh flies around in circles around the group, an aurora appearing that washes light onto them. Everyone&#146;s injuries, minus their clothing, are healed, and their power strengthened. Verity comments that it looks like everyone is healthy again, and Bonji chimes in, saying that it&#146;s the power of Ho-Oh. Meanwhile, Shadow nods to Lucario and yells out to Ho-Oh, &#147;Let&#146;s have a battle!&#148; The legendary bird tips its head and takes flight, Shadow and Lucario running over to take their place on the battlefield. Lucario and Ho-Oh engage in heated battle, which continues until long in the night. (No winner is declared.)</p>

Nurse Joy unsuspectingly says that that&#8217;s nice until she realizes what he just said; Shadow laughs in response.
