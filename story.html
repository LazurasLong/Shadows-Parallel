<p class='Para'><i><b>"Charmander, I choose you!" Shadow threw</i></b> his Pok&#233;mon's Pok&#233;ball onto the battlefield to face an opposing Bulbasaur, a green turtle-esque Pok&#233;mon with a leaf bud on its back. The Fire-type orange lizard that came out of its Pok&#233;ball had a type advantage over its Grass-type adversary, so Shadow knew that this would be an easy battle.</p>
<p class='Para'>"Use Flamethrower!" Shadow commanded, throwing his fist into the air. Charmander spewed a great deal of fire at Bulbasaur that rushed across the battlefield in blazing heat. </p>
<p class='Para'>Suddenly, Shadow's vision changed. Instead of being in an intense battle, he was lying in his bed in his messy, cluttered room; it was all just a dream. Sunlight was poking through the blinds on his window, indicating that it the day was already well underway.</p>
<p class='Para'>Shadow was still in the midst waking up, but once he realized what had happened, his mind snapped awake as he screamed aloud, "I'm late to Professor Oak's ceremony!"</p>
<p class='Para'>Opening his dresser to put on his regular clothes and taking a moment to appreciate a poster of the three starter Pok&#233;mon&mdash;the Fire-type Charmander, Grass-type Bulbasaur, and Water-type Squirtle that was essentially a blue turtle&mdash;, Shadow dashed out of his bedroom and down the stairs of the two-story house to the living room where his dad was already awake. Flabbergasted, Shadow asked him, "Why didn't you wake me up?" </p>
<p class='Para'>"I forgot," came the lame response.</p>
<p class='Para'>"Well, what are you waiting for? Come on, we have to get to Professor Oak's lab!" Without waiting for an answer, Shadow dashed out of the door, but he could hear his father running behind him.</p>
<p class='Para'>Luckily, Professor Oak's lab wasn't too far away from Shadow's house&mdash;not less than a kilometer&mdash;although it was located at the top of a hill; Shadow found himself exhausted by the time he made it to the pristine building. The site itself was located around lots of forest and even had a windmill in the backyard. </p>
<p class='Para'>Professor Sycamore was just outside of the lab, giving water to an Oddish and Bellsprout&mdash;blue and yellow Plant-type Pok&#233;mon, respectively&mdash;via a watering can. Shadow called his name as he ran up to him, and Oak turned and said hello back.</p>
<p class='Para'>"So you're the fourth Trainer of the day to receive a starter Pok&#233;mon," he mused. "Follow me." </p>
<p class='Para'>Shadow was led into the main building, through the reception area, and up some stairs. While walking, he said aloud, "I've been thinking a lot about it, and I'm going to pick Charmander!"</p>
<p class='Para'>"I'm afraid Charmander has already been taken by a Trainer who came before you," Oak replied.</p>
<p class='Para'>Shadow was crestfallen for a second, but he was undeterred. "Then I'll go with Bulbasaur!"</p>
<p class='Para'>"Bulbasaur was also chosen by another Trainer."</p>
<p class='Para'>"Fine. I'll choose Squirtle!"</p>
<p class='Para'>"Squirtle is also unavailable."</p>
<p class='Para'>When Shadow heard those words, his blood turned to ice. "What will I do then?" he asked. "Am I going to have to start my journey without a Pok&#233;mon?" </p>
<p class='Para'>"Not necessarily," Oak eluded. The two reached the top of the staircase and were in another room that presumably was where the three starter Pok&#233;mon were; in the center were three different small cushions.</p>
<p class='Para'>Something caught Shadow's eye on the balcony of the room opposite him. It appeared to be a blue tail that was sticking up. Immediately excited, he queried, "Is that the Pok&#233;mon I'm going to get?"</p>
<p class='Para'>"Yes," Oak said with reluctance, "but this one is&hellip;different." As he spoke, Shadow clambered up the stairs to meet his new Pok&#233;mon friend, and he got a good look at it: It's body was primarily blue, with black legs and three-toed paws. Oddly enough, it seemed to be standing on just the tip of its feet; where its knee joint would normally be was instead an inverted joint, suggesting to Shadow that its foot was simply very long. From the middle of its body to its neck was a black, spiky coloring. The blue tail he had seen was mostly straight, except for at almost the tip where it bent like a short checkmark. On the back of its three-fingered paws were white, rounded bumps, and where its neck was was a yellow collar. On its face was what looked like a black bandit mask surrounding its red eyes extending down the bridge of its nose to just under the tip. On either side of the mask were two teardrop-shaped appendages in addition to its short, cat-like ears on the top of its head.</p>
<p class='Para'>As Shadow ran towards it, however, the Pok&#233;mon showed reluctance to even say hello and instead forced Shadow to chase it while the two ran around the room. While this happened, Oak simply stood where he was, and eventually the two found themselves right before him. </p>
<p class='Para'>"This is Riolu," Oak said. "It is a Fighting- and Steel-type." Oak placed something in Shadow's hand: a red-and-white spherical device. "That's its Pok&#233;ball.</p>
<p class='Para'>"Although&hellip;" he said as Shadow began playing a game of catch with the Pok&#233;ball with Riolu to try to get it inside, the latter batting the device away everytime. Eventually Riolu smacked it hard enough to flying into Shadow's face, where it left a mark that caused Riolu to laugh. "It doesn't really like being inside it," Oak finished.</p>
<p class='Para'>That was the time Shadow's dad joined them, saying, "Look at the two of you, having fun already!"</p>
<p class='Para'>"What will I do with you?" Shadow muttered under his breath as he prepared to leave. "I'm confident I'll earn your friendship!" he said, looking right into Riolu eyes. Looking back up at Professor Oak, he said, "Thank you for giving me this opportunity!" </p>
<p class='Para'>Riolu was generous enough to follow Shadow outside&mdash;the last obedient thing it would do for a while, Shadow would discover&mdash;and the latter said goodbye to both his dad and Professor Oak as he started walking down the hill he came up.</p>

<p class='Para'>Shadow is tugging along Riolu on a rope as the latter refuses to move, and Shadow mutters to himself if this is going to last the entire journey. Eventually, he gets fed up and unties Riolu, asking it to walk with him, to which it refuses. He asks it if it even likes him, and it blatantly shakes its head. Shadow tells it that the two are stuck together anyway, and asks for a handshake; Riolu turns its back in refusal. Exasperated, he looks around and spots a Pidgey perching in some tall grass. He immediately throws a Pok&#233;ball at it, but it reappears almost instantly, and Shadow remembers that he has to battle it first. He asks Riolu to battle to it, but instead, it climbs onto a rock and watches. Shadow picks up a rock, intending to fight it himself, but the Spearow flies off. Shadow throws the rock anyways, which hits a different Spearow. It mistakes Riolu as being the one who threw the rock and begins attacking it. Doing something other than lazing around for the first time, Riolu fights back with a Force Palm, driving the Spearow into a tree which triggers a thousand more to come out and attack. Shadow and Riolu immediately begin running away as rain starts to pour down, chased by the flock, but they are two quick and quickly overtake Riolu. Shadow pushes his way to the center and picks up Riolu, protecting it and proceeding to run away. More running leads them to run straight off a cliff into a river, and when they resurface, they find the Spearow are still chasing them. Yet more running leads them to fall into a ditch. Shadow puts Riolu behind him and asks it to go into its Pok&#233;ball, and then stands in front of it and taunts the Spearow. As the Spearow build up a strike, lightning begins to crash down. Just before the flock attacks Shadow, though, Riolu jumps up and unleashes a blast of Aura which drives the flock away. Shadow and Riolu then realize the bond that they have just formed. The clouds clear&mdash;it&#8217;s still daytime&mdash;and Ho-Oh, one of the legendary Pok&#233;mon of Kanto, flies over and drops a Rainbow Wing over Shadow, who picks it up. For a second, Shadow is mystified. He then promises Riolu that one day they would meet the Pok&#233;mon (Shadow doesn&#8217;t know its name yet). The two then make their way to a Pok&#233;mon Center to heal.</p>

<p class='Para'>Shadow is in the middle of an intense battle with Erika, the third Gym leader of his journey. After defeating her Tangela, Riolu unexpectedly evolves into Lucario, and the two high five after Shadow officially receives his third badge. They then start walking towards a Pok&#233;mon Center and detour towards a forest. While walking, Shadow spots a Caterpie that becomes quickly hostile to him. After a quick battle, Shadow captures Caterpie and starts continues to the Pok&#233;mon Center, where he heals his Pok&#233;mon and phones his dad. The latter is merely concerned about Shadow&#8217;s wellbeing, and Shadow quickly loses his patience. Nonetheless, he proceeds to fill his father in about his accomplishments since settings out on his journey; namely, getting Caterpie and winning three Gym badges. Nurse Joy comes out of her back room and informs Shadow that Lucario has been healed; it is on top of a cart that Nurse Joy&#8217;s Chansey is carrying. As they&#8217;re talking, a different Trainer with a Vaporeon appears and talks about having battled Entei a few minutes ago. Shadow says a hasty goodbye to his dad and exits the Pok&#233;mon Center; other trainers exit as well; they&#8217;re all looking for Entei. After some searching in the forest, Shadow sees Entei standing on top of a rock in a clearing. However, to his right is another trainer: Verity! Armed with a Piplup, she too wants to fight Entei and the two race to the clearing in hopes of being the first to battle. Once they make it, though, they see a third trainer, named Sorrel, with a Lucario of his own on the other side of the clearing. All three of them try to fight Entei, but Entei disdains the attack and flees to elsewhere. Shadow and Verity argue, accusing each other of being the reason Entei fled, and the two agree to a battle. Sorrel, on the other hand, refuses to fight, and leaves with his Lucario, telling them that it&#8217;s due to rain soon. Verity&#8217;s Piplup&#8217;s Hydro Pump misses Lucario and instead hits what was thought to be rocks outside of the clearing, but to both of their horror, an Onyx rises, maddened. Both Trainers and their Pok&#233;mon flee the scene, and after a long chase through a rock ravine Shadow manages to calm the Onyx down. True enough, it begins raining, and Shadow and Verity decide to find shelter together. On the way, they encounter a Charmander sitting on a rock. Shadow wonders who put it there when another person, Cross, appears, with a Midnight Form Lycanroc. He explains that since the Charmander was weak, there was no sense in keeping it, and so he left it out in the rain to toughen it up. Shadow is disgusted by this, and Cross walks away. Verity notes that the fire on Charmander&#8217;s tail is tiny&mdash;if it ever went out completely&#8230;The two resolve to find shelter, fast, and make it to a cave. Upon entering, they see that Sorrel has taken refuge in there as well. Sorrel at first becomes mad at Shadow for leaving the Charmander in the rain, but Verity explains the situation. After realizing what had happened, Sorrel heals Charmander, and, after feeding it medicine, wraps it in cloth to keep warm. Shadow vouches to hold it to spread his body heat. The three begin discussing their pasts; Shadow and Verity are both on journeys, and Sorrel wants to learn more about the legendary Pok&#233;mon of Kanto. He proceeds to tell them both the tale of the Burned Tower, and how Ho-Oh resurrected them. He also gives a picture, which Shadow immediately recognizes. He pulls out the Rainbow Wing from his jacket pocket, and the two marvel at it. Sorrel explains that Ho-Oh gives the Rainbow Wing to a Trainer that it likes&mdash;a so-called &#8220;rainbow hero&#8221; that is destined to battle the legendary Pok&#233;mon&mdash;and suggests that Shadow travel to Mount Tensei, where Ho-Oh is said to come if a Rainbow Wing is placed. The three decide to travel to Mount Tensei together. Just then, Entei arrives in the cave along with some wild Pok&#233;mon, and takes up residence on an elevated spot in the cave, taking particular notice of Shadow&#8217;s Rainbow Wing. The three leave it alone, and Sorrel says that it&#8217;s going to be cold despite the existence of a fire. He puts his Lucario back into its Pok&#233;ball, as does Verity with Piplup, but Shadow explains that Lucario does not appreciate being in its Pok&#233;ball. The other two Pok&#233;mon hop out of their Pok&#233;balls as well, and they all spend the night sleeping together.</p>

<p class='Para'>Lucario is the first to wake up the following morning and immediately notices that the rain has stopped and that Entei has gone. The others start waking up and when Shadow awakes he sees that Charmander&#8217;s tail flame is back to full strength. Shadow asks Charmander if it would like to go with him, and after a slight bit of hesitance, it agrees. Shadow puts it in a Pok&#233;ball. They all decide to vacate the cave, and after looking at Sorrel&#8217;s map start heading for the nearest town. First, though, they go for a swim (minus Sorrel and Lucario, who stay dry sitting against a tree). Shadow ends up fighting a Pinsir with Caterpie, and after flinging the former down with a String Shot the latter evolves into Metapod. The Pinsir gets away, but Shadow is just happy that his Pok&#233;mon evolved. Once they make it inside the (unnamed) town, Shadow wastes no time going straight to the local battlefield, where he and Charmander face off against a Jigglypuff. Charmander wins and evolves to Charmeleon while running back to Shadow. The next day, they all head towards the library, where Sorrel begins researching more about Ho-Oh and the rainbow hero prophecy. He uncovers more information about the legendary Pok&#233;mon: long ago, Ho-Oh watched over the works of people and Pok&#233;mon, and everyone was given energy via an aura of happiness. However, a heart of evil touched the Rainbow Wing, and its color vanished. Shadow heads back to the battlefield. After defeating a Snorlax, Cross comes up and challenges him, saying that he heard a rumor that Shadow was using Charmander [sic]. When Shadow sends out Charmeleon, Cross maintains that weak Pok&#233;mon who evolve are still weak. Shadow is sure that he will win as he is up against incorrectly-trained Pok&#233;mon. Cross uses Incineroar, and Shadow uses Charmeleon-Cross comments that useless Pok&#233;mon that evolve are still useless. Despite Shadow&#8217;s and Charmeleon&#8217;s tenacity, Charmeleon is badly defeated, and Cross proceeds to insult Shadow, citing that he relied on cheap friendship and tried to use moves he couldn&#8217;t use. Shadow has no retort. He can&#8217;t believe his loss and is extremely upset despite Verity&#8217;s and Sorrel&#8217;s attempts to console him. He openly admits that he would have won had he used Lucario instead, and runs away into the forest when Sorrel calls him out on being no better than Cross if that was his mindset. The others chase him, but Lucario is the only one who keeps pace; Verity and Sorrel are left behind. Eventually, Shadow slows to a walk, still walking away, and declares the two losers. He asks if Lucario agrees with him, to which it says no. Shadow says that he wishes that he had chosen Bulbasaur or Squirtle instead. Lucario stops following Shadow and stands while the latter continues walking away until it is out of sight. When Shadow glances back, it is completely gone. Sitting down against a tree, he questions whether or not he even needs Lucario, and sits down against a tree. He takes out the Rainbow Wing and says to Ho-Oh that he thought he was the rainbow hero. Marshadow slowly appears from behind Shadow (he doesn&#8217;t notice it) and possesses him, giving his eyes a purple glow and putting him into a sleep-like state. The Rainbow Wing falls out of Shadow&#8217;s hand and is corrupted, losing its color.</p>

<p class='Para'>Shadow is sleeping in bed, and in a dream throws his alarm clock, disabling it. He then wakes up and realizes just how late he is to the first day of school. He quickly gets dressed in a full panic, stopping for a second to appreciate the poster on his wall depicting three snazzy-looking cars, and heads outside of his room to tell his father about the ordeal. The former runs over to the school to avoid being late. Once Shadow makes it there, he sees Professor Oak, his teacher, outside giving water to bushes. After saying hello, Oak comments that out of the four students late, he was the latest. Shadow proceeds to his first class, where he attempts to focus on the current lesson: rainbows. However, he feels that something is missing in his day, and catches a glimpse of something blue below his desk. He looks over, but sees nothing; instead, his classmates Verity and Sorrel call him weird. Shadow also thinks he sees Ho-Oh in the skies, but upon closer inspection, it&#8217;s just a plane. Once the class is over, Shadow walks up to the rooftop and stares outside of the chain link fence for a long time. Verity and Sorrel come up, Verity asking if Shadow ever got bored of the view. Shadow asks them what is beyond the school. Sorrel responds by saying there&#8217;s forest, and then a town, and then more forest and another town; beyond that is the sea. Verity says that it&#8217;s just more of the same after that. Shadow tells them that he wants to explore what&#8217;s out there. Verity and Sorrel chime in; no school, staying up, absolute freedom&#8230; Shadow says that he always has his buddy, but stops himself when he realizes that his &#8220;buddy&#8221; no longer exists. He sees a vision of his partner on his shoulder and begins to cry. His friends tell him to pull himself together, but when Shadow looks back up, they&#8217;re gone. Behind him, he sees that same figure, hazy but there. He begins to run towards it, and he suddenly finds himself running along a plaza. He says that they used to run like this all the time. The ground starts crumbling into chunks and falling into the void, and Shadow tries to catch up. He jumps and catches his partner, remembering its name, Lucario. Suddenly, the two are transported to the skies above a meadow and fall to the ground in terror. When Shadow hits the ground, he wakes up in the waking world, still underneath the tree. He immediately sees Lucario in front of him and hugs it, crying and saying that it was all his fault. Beside him, the Rainbow Wing regains its color. Verity asks Shadow if he had any idea how long they&#8217;d been searching for him, and Sorrel lectures him, saying that you cannot expect to win every battle and that it&#8217;s the losses that you grow strong from, but that&#8217;s just his opinion. Shadow gets up, and the group goes elsewhere in the forest.</p>

<p class='Para'>The group makes a fire in a circular clearing of trees; a thin fog has rolled in, and it is still nighttime. Shadow is explaining the dream that he had, the others listening in closely. Verity is in shock at the very concept of a world without Pok&#233;mon. Sorrel, on the other hand, has a different perspective: it is possible for Pok&#233;mon to leave us. He describes a time in his early childhood: His parents were away most of the time, so the family Luxray took care of Sorrel. One day, however, Sorrel hurt himself outside in a blizzard and quickly started freezing. Luxray bounded across and laid down with him in the center to keep him from doing so. In the morning, when the blizzard was gone, Luxray was frozen solid; it had died smiling. A rescue team found Sorrel with Luxray, and as they carried him away, he screamed his protector&#8217;s name. Afterwards, Sorrel was reluctant to make friends with any Pok&#233;mon, until he found Lucario. Shadow and Verity are somber after hearing the tale and offer their condolences. Meanwhile, Marshadow slowly appears from Shadow&#8217;s shadow, but this time they spot it. Lucario is instantly aggressive and fires an Aura Sphere at Marshadow&#8217;s location, but it rescinds long before it would have hit. Instead, the Aura Sphere hits the tree and shakes it. A group of Primape come down from the branches and quickly gather the team in a circle, repeatedly launching them in the air. Sorrel advises Shadow to use Metapod, as fighting back would only make them madder. Shadow manages to dismount the circle of Primape and takes out Metapod; he holds it and has it use String Shot, running around the ring. The aggressors are ensnared, and everyone dismounts before they can attack again. While running, Metapod evolves into Butterfree. Shadow has it use Sleep Powder on the Primape, who had broken out of the String Shot, and they all fall asleep. The group then continues walking, no longer threatened. They quickly reach a stream, and Verity gets out her Lapras. They all board Lapras and begin sailing downstream.</p>

<p class='Para'>The group is still going downstream on Lapras&#8217; back when day breaks, but they eventually disembark and continue walking. As they are going through a forest and are about to reach a cliff, however, they hear a Pok&#233;mon scream off to the left. After looking, they identify it as a pink Butterfree who is being hunted by a Fearow. Shadow immediately goes to protect it, unleashing his own Butterfree and having it chase the Fearow away with Gust. When the belligerent flees, the two Butterfree stop for a second, the pink one thanking the other. Sorrel points out that the pink one is pink, as opposed to blue, and Verity concludes that it must be female. The pink Butterfree flies off. Once they are at the edge of the cliff, the Rainbow Wing begins glowing. Shadow takes it out of his pocket, and it lights a visible beam all the way to a mountain that isn&#8217;t too far away: Mount Tensei. They&#8217;re in front of another cliff when Shadow spots a swarm of Butterfree flying together in the distance. Sorrel comments that it&#8217;s mating season for the Butterfree right now. Shadow takes out his own Butterfree, and within a few seconds, the pink one from before flies down to greet them. Shadow encourages their relationship, saying that they are awesome together, but Verity warns that should the two Butterfree go off together, it would be goodbye. Shadow becomes distraught at the concept of saying goodbye, and Sorrel states that in the end, it is his decision. Butterfree itself flies down to Shadow, who asks it if it wants to go. Butterfree responds after hesitation by flying behind his back. Shadow says that it should go with the other Butterfree and that if they don&#8217;t go now, they will be left behind (in the background, the Butterfree swarm has continued flying some distance). As his Butterfree goes to be with the pink one, Shadow praises them, saying that they are both really great Pok&#233;mon (with a slight pause between &#8220;both&#8221; and &#8220;really&#8221;). As they begin waving goodbye to each other, Shadow and Butterfree both start crying profusely. They continue until the swarm has left; long after the sun has set. Shadow says that he is glad to have met Butterfree and that even though it&#8217;s not here, they are still good friends. Sorrel comments that though people raise Pok&#233;mon, Pok&#233;mon live their own lives. Suddenly, a bolt of lightning crashes down behind the group. Turning around, they witness Raikou, the third of the legendary trio, standing on top of a rock looking down at them. With another flash of lightning, Raikou is gone as soon as it appeared. Their resolve strengthened, the group pushes forward to reach Mount Tensei.</p>

<p class='Para'>The group is at the base of Mount Tensei, walking along through thick fog. Many Pok&#233;mon are scattered about, looking agitated, and Verity comments about it. Bonji suddenly says that it&#8217;s because they want to meet Ho-Oh and receive its power. Bonji gets down from the rock he was on and starts sniffing the air, catching a faint scent of Ho-Oh. Shadow pulls out the Rainbow Wing, and Bonji is amazed. Verity is surprised that he knows of it, and Sorrel recognizes him as being the author of the book in the library. Bonji says his name, explaining that for the past 20 years he&#8217;s been on a quest, searching for Ho-Oh being a part of his research. He elaborates that he&#8217;s pulled data from many places and that the data all shows Mount Tensei to be the place of Ho-Oh&#8217;s next appearance. They agree to travel together to the summit, and Bonji comments that the Rainbow Wing&#8217;s shine is the shine of youth and that it&#8217;s almost too beautiful for him to look upon. As they are walking, Bonji says that it&#8217;s probably thanks in large part to the Rainbow Wing that the group has come across Entei, Raikou, and Suicune. He goes on to say that Ho-Oh wants to know if there is a young person suitable enough to be the Rainbow Hero, which means that there may be someone guiding Shadow from the shadows. Shadow recalls seeing one, and Bonji says that it&#8217;s most likely the extremely rare Pok&#233;mon Marshadow. Marshadow is a guide from the shadows, and that when the Rainbow Wing&#8217;s color fades, it seals it back up and makes it right. The fog has been getting thinner as they&#8217;ve been walking uphill, and suddenly the Rainbow Wing glows; when Shadow takes it out, it lights a direct beam of light to a crystal rock at the summit. Bonji prophesizes that when a Rainbow Flower blooms upon Rainbow Rock, Ho-Oh shall appear, and Shadow is overexcited, running ahead.</p>

<p class='Para'>When the group makes it to the summit, they find that more Pok&#233;mon are standing on ledges, waiting. There is a circular area fit for a battlefield, and in front of them is Rainbow Rock. Sorrel says that that&#8217;s where Shadow should place the Rainbow Wing, and the latter runs over to plant it. However, Incineroar stops him, using Throat Chop in front of him to knock him back. Cross appears from behind the rock and demands the Rainbow Wing, saying that the Trainer who gets to battle Ho-Oh is the strongest and that he is said person. Sorrel defies that, saying that that&#8217;s not how it works, and Verity chimes in, saying that the one to battle Ho-Oh is the one chosen by it. Cross calls them soft, using the jingle &#8220;might makes right, and that&#8217;s it&#8221;. Answering Shadow&#8217;s questions, he declares weak people trash, and people that lose worse than trash. The Rainbow Wing suddenly glows, and Marshadow appears from Shadow&#8217;s shadow and jumps on top of a ledge. Shadow recognizes it as being Marshadow; Cross is satisfied to meet the guardian from the shadow; Sorrel says that it&#8217;s the Pok&#233;mon they saw that night; and Verity declares it cute. Bonji says that its only purpose is to observe the proceedings.</p>

<p class='Para'>Shadow releases Charmeleon from its Pok&#233;ball to battle Cross&#8217; Incineroar. The latter immediately starts with Flamethrower, which Charmeleon dodges. Charmeleon retaliates with Slash, which lands a direct hit. Incineroar uses Throat Chop, and Charmeleon hops around unharmed. Charmeleon uses Slash yet again, and the two are locked in a power contest. Incineroar then uses Flamethrower, and Charmeleon is caught directly, blocking the flames. While in the Flamethrower, however, it evolves into Charizard. Cross doesn&#8217;t care, saying that weak Pok&#233;mon who evolve are still weak. He continues with Throat Chop, and Charizard uses Slash; they end up hitting each other. Incineroar uses Flamethrower, and Charizard flies around to dodge it. Charizard uses Dragon Rage, and it&#8217;s a direct hit. Shadow commands Charizard to build up its power to end it with a big attack. Incineroar continues the onslaught with Fire Fang, and Charizard dodges. While it's in the air, Incineroar jumps and grabs it to bring it down. Before it hits the ground, Charizard uses Seismic Toss and flings Incineroar across the stage. Cross aims to end the fight with Flamethrower; Charizard does the same. It&#8217;s a fire contest, but Charizard&#8217;s flame powers into a fully-fledged fireball and Incineroar loses, unable to battle. Cross gets on his knees and returns Incineroar. Shadow takes out the Rainbow Wing and walks over to the Rainbow Walk, but after he walks by Cross, the latter says that he saw Ho-Oh too. Cross continues, saying that it didn&#8217;t give him the Rainbow Wing even after he&#8217;s done everything to become the strongest. He asks why it had to be Shadow, and that if Ho-Oh doesn&#8217;t consider him the strongest, he&#8217;ll crush it. Shadow intervenes, saying that he wants to get stronger as well, but explains that he only got this far with the help of his friends, so he knows that it&#8217;s not just about strength. Cross asks him what he even battles for, and Shadow responds that it&#8217;s because he wants to make friends. Cross doesn&#8217;t reply, instead running at Shadow and wrestling the Rainbow Wing away from him. He climbs up to the top of Rainbow Rock, the Rainbow Wing losing its color as he holds it, and places it where it should be. A dark beam appears from Rainbow Rock and clouds flood the sky. The ground turns corrupt and purple as well. Bonji comments that the Rainbow Wing loses its color when touched by one with an evil heart. Marshadow appears from the shadows and grabs Cross, tossing him aside; Lycanroc catches him. Bonji nervously repeats that Marshadow seals it back up and makes it right.</p>

<p class='Para'>Cross vows to pound Marshadow as well as he recovers from being thrown. Lycanroc uses Crush Claw, but before it makes it Marshadow fires a beam of darkness towards it; Lycanroc&#8217;s eyes turn purple, and it turns around, mind-controlled. It starts attacking Cross, who runs away from it. Just before a ball of energy hits Cross, Charizard flies in front of him, taking the blow. Verity asks if he sees it now that Charizard never forgot that he was once its trainer. Shadow comments that it&#8217;s just like Charizard to be awesome. Meanwhile, Marshadow fires more dark beams of light all around, mind-controlling every Pok&#233;mon around except for the group&#8217;s. An Electabuzz fires a Thunderbolt towards Cross and Charizard&mdash;the two jump away in response&mdash;and a Pidgeotto flies towards Bonji, Sorrel, and Shadow; Sorrel&#8217;s Lucario knocks it away. Bonji says that it looks as if Marshadow wants to control the group as well and that Ho-Oh will never appear now that it&#8217;s come to this. At Marshadow&#8217;s command, a group of Pok&#233;mon fire attacks at the group, forcing them to retreat. Bonji says that Shadow has got to get the Rainbow Wing back; Marshadow is getting its power from it, and only Shadow can get it back. Sorrel and Verity help defend Shadow while the latter starts making his way to Marshadow. Charizard Flamethrowers a Graveller and Magmar; Piplup uses Hydro Pump against a Pidgeotto; Charizard body slams an Arbok; Shadow runs on top of a charging Ryhorn; Sorrel&#8217;s Lucario uses Bone Rush to block a Graveller as well as the Ryhorn; and just before it fires a Stone Edge, Cross tackles Lycanroc, pinning it down. Lycanroc proceeds to bite Cross&#8217; arm; Cross remembers that it bit him the day they met as well. He commands Lycanroc to remember as well, and it snaps out of its trance. Shadow makes it to Marshadow and demands that it give him the Rainbow Wing; it responds by leaping down from the rock and firing dark balls of energy at Lucario. Lucario retaliates by dodging the first two and hitting the third one back with a Bone Rush; Marshadow deflects it. The two engage in close combat, Lucario still having a Bone Rush, but Marshadow lands a blow, and Lucario is knocked back. Behind the two, Sorrel&#8217;s Lucario is hit, but before the opposing Pok&#233;mon can do more damage Cross steps in with Lycanroc and counters an incoming fireball. However, a Nidoqueen and Nidoking both use Rock Throw, attacking the party with boulders. The defenders run away to avoid getting crushed. An Arbok wraps around Charizard&#8217;s neck, incapacitating it. Meanwhile, Lucario is hit again with one of Marshadow&#8217;s attacks, but Shadow is anything but deterred; Lucario keeps fighting. Marshadow begins glowing, its previously grey hair and eyebrows becoming green and red, respectively, and unleashes a flurry of energy balls. Lucario attempts to dodge them but is hit by one and subsequently all the others. Shadow responds immediately by having Lucario use Aura Sphere mid-air; Marshadow jumps in a kicking position. It is a power standoff, but Marshadow wins, and Lucario is directly hit. An explosion occurs from the energy exertion, knocking both Shadow and the rest of the party back.</p>

<p class='Para'>Shadow immediately gets back up to see Lucario lying on the ground a few feet away and runs toward it; while he does so, Marshadow stops glowing and stumbles for a second. As Shadow crouches down, he sees that the mind-controlled Pok&#233;mon are advancing on him; he picks up Lucario and runs away from them until he reaches the edge of a ledge. Turning back, he sees his opponents all lines up, ready to strike. Shadow attempts to run away, but the Nidoqueen fires a Flamethrower at him and hits him directly. The others try to advance and defend him but are suppressed by other enslaved Pok&#233;mon; Shadow is all on his own. When the dust from the impact clears, Shadow is on the ground a few feet away from Lucario; the two begin crawling towards each other. Out of the corner of his eye, he sees the other Pok&#233;mon continuing to encroach, and takes Lucario&#8217;s Pok&#233;ball and rolls it over to it, pleading for it to get inside. He says that he knows it can&#8217;t stand being inside Pok&#233;balls, but it would be protected. The other Pok&#233;mon start charging an attack, and Shadow stands up to face them. He turns his cap around and says with perfect clarity, &#8220;Now you look. I don&#8217;t think you know who you&#8217;re dealing with. I&#8217;m Shadow, from Pallet Town, and I&#8217;m gonna be the world&#8217;s&#8230;greatest Pok&#233;mon master! Mess with me, and you&#8217;re gonna lose!&#8221; Immediately as he says the last word the Pok&#233;mon fire, and Lucario runs to protect him. Shadow sees this and stops it, instead burying it in his arms to protect it. He lets out a scream as the blast hits, and he is knocked to the ground, Lucario next to him. He asks why Lucario won&#8217;t get in its Pok&#233;ball, and his partner replies in English, &#8220;It&#8217;s because&#8230;It&#8217;s because I always want&#8230;to be with you.&#8221; The other Pok&#233;mon charge one final shot, and Shadow forces Lucario into its Pok&#233;ball. Holding the Pok&#233;ball tightly to his chest, Shadow is hit by the attack. An explosion ensues, so great that it is visible from several mountains away. The rest of the party including Cross gathers to watch, and Charizard flings the Arbok off its neck. When the smoke clears, Lucario&#8217;s Pok&#233;ball rolls away, and Shadow&#8217;s hat lands on top of it. When Lucario comes out of the Pok&#233;ball, the hat is on top of it. In front of it is Shadow&#8217;s body, transparent with pure energy irradiating from it. The Rainbow Wing begins to disintegrate in Marshadow&#8217;s hand. Lucario takes the hat and attempts to place it on Shadow&#8217;s head, but as it puts it down the body fades away into nothingness; the Rainbow Wing completely disintegrates as well. When the last sparkles have disappeared, Lucario takes the hat and buries it in its face, crying out. A massive blast of Aura engulfs everything on top of the mountain; it is so strong that the clouds fade and reveal a blue sky. When the smoke disappears, the opposing Pok&#233;mon are no longer mind-controlled. Everybody focuses on Lucario, who is crying into the hat. It lets out a shout that reaches into the heavens.</p>

<p class='Para'>Shadow awakens where the final blast hit him, but one thing is severely different: the entire world, himself included, is grayscale. He gets up and asks where everybody is. He hears Lucario crying behind him and turns around. He takes a step in its direction, and suddenly the entire world changes: he is now standing in a color-filled grassy plain at sunset, though he himself is still greyscaled. In the waking world, particles begin to gather where Shadow&#146;s body was. Shadow hears Lucario again and starts running in its direction; the landscape changes again, the sky now being grey and the ground now being an endless grass plain. There are more particles where Shadow&#146;s body was, and they begin to move around more actively. As Shadow is running, he chuckles a little, commenting that they used to run like this all the time. The plain is suddenly filled with flowers as a small beam of light opens amid the particles. As Shadow continues running the sky changes to a blue color, and he starts running on top of water. The particles become more fantastic, and the beam enlarges to create a portal; Lucario drops the hat as it stares in amazement. Shadow is now running through a rainbow of colors as Lucario jumps into the portal; it appears in the sky in Shadow&#146;s reality as Shadow returns to running on water. Shadow jumps to meet Lucario and the two hug mid-air; once they connect Shadow&#146;s body becomes color again. The light in the waking world becomes dazzlingly bright, and when it fades, Shadow is alive, standing with Lucario. Verity and Sorrel run over to meet Shadow, and Sorrel comments that he&#146;s alright. Charizard also lets out a yell. Suddenly, particles begin gathering in Shadow&#146;s hand, and the Rainbow Wing reforms; the Rainbow Rock, as well as the floor, also return to a normal color. Bonji repeats that when a Rainbow Flower blooms on Rainbow Rock, Ho-Oh shall appear, and urges Shadow onward. Shadow climbs to the top of Rainbow Rock and deposits the feather; when he does so a brief flash of rainbow-colored light beams into the sky and a rainbow forms, Rainbow Rock being one of its bases. On the other end of the rainbow, Ho-Oh is flying towards them. Bonji continues speaking, now saying that the one who is guided by the Rainbow Wing may meet Ho-Oh and become the rainbow hero. Ho-Oh flies around in circles around the group, an aurora appearing that washes light onto them. Everyone&#146;s injuries, minus their clothing, are healed, and their power strengthened. Verity comments that it looks like everyone is healthy again, and Bonji chimes in, saying that it&#146;s the power of Ho-Oh. Meanwhile, Shadow nods to Lucario and yells out to Ho-Oh, &#147;Let&#146;s have a battle!&#148; The legendary bird tips its head and takes flight, Shadow and Lucario running over to take their place on the battlefield. Lucario and Ho-Oh engage in heated battle, which continues until long in the night. (No winner is declared.)</p>

<p class='Para'>The group arrives at the nearest Pok&#233;mon Center, and Shadow goes to heal Lucario. Nurse Joy asks who they battled this time, and Shadow responds truthfully. Nurse Joy unsuspectingly says that that&#8217;s nice until she realizes what he just said; Shadow laughs in response. Outside the Pok&#233;mon Center, the group says goodbye to Cross, who vows to battle Shadow again. Cross tells him not to lose to anyone before then before walking off.</p>
