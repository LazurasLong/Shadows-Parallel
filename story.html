	I. Shadow wakes up in his bed, having overslept due to throwing and
	disabling his alarm clock. In a panic, he gets dressed and takes his father
	with him to Professor Oak's lab, where he finds that he was the fourth of
	the trainers to arrive. While going to the main room, Shadow is eager to
	pick a starter, but Oak informs him that all of the main ones have already
	been chosen. Shadow immediately becomes crestfallen and wonders what that
	would mean for his journey. Oak shows him a Riolu that hasn't been picked,
	and Shadow is elated, but the former explains that the Riolu had a somewhat
	bad temper. Shadow is not dissuaded and immediately attempts to become
	friends with it; he receives the cold shoulder in return. Oak hands the new
	Trainer Riolu's Pok&#233;ball, along with the caveat that Riolu hates being
	in Pok&#233;balls. Shadow finds that out the hard way when he is slapped in
	the face with it while trying to coax Riolu in. His dad comes in and says
	that if they're already playing catch, they're great friends; those words
	empower Shadow and make him believe that he will eventually become friends
	with Riolu&#8230; eventually. After muttering what he would do with it, he
	prepares to leave and says goodbye to both Oak and his father, and then
	begins his journey.
</p>
<p>
	a) Shadow is sleeping in bed, and in a dream throws his
	Pok&#233;ball-shaped alarm clock, disabling it. He then wakes up and
	realizes just how late he is to the ceremony. He quickly gets dressed in a
	full panic, stopping for a second to appreciate the poster on his wall
	depicting the three starter Pok&#233;mon, and heads outside of his room to
	tell his father about the ordeal. The two immediately head outside and
	hurry over to Professor Oak's lab. Once Shadow makes it there, he sees Oak
	outside giving water to an Oddish and Bellsprout. After saying hello, Oak
	recognizes him as being the fourth trainer of the day to receive a starter
	Pok&#233;mon. (Shadow is unbeknownst that the regular starter Pok&#233;mon
	are all unavailable.) Heading up the stairs to the central area, Shadow
	explains that he wants to pick a Charmander, but Oak tells him that it was
	already taken. He counters with Bulbasaur; same response. No luck with
	Squirtle. Shadow asks Oak what he could then do; would he start his journey
	without a Pok&#233;mon? The latter responds that he has one last
	Pok&#233;mon, but that is was&#8230;different. Shadow for the first time
	notices a Riolu standing on the balcony above them, and is quick to ask if
	that was the Pok&#233;mon Oak was referring to. Oak confirms, and Shadow
	immediately climbs up the stairs to greet his soon-to-be partner. The Riolu
	is hesitant to even say hello, however, and Shadow is forced to chase it
	around before they end up before Oak. The latter hands Shadow Riolu's
	Pok&#233;ball but explains the caveat that this Riolu hates being inside
	its Pok&#233;ball. Nonetheless, Shadow attempts to coax it inside but
	instead gets a laugh out of Riolu as the latter slaps its Pok&#233;ball
	into Shadow's face. Shadow mutters to himself what he would do with Riolu
	as they all prepare for Shadow to leave. Shadow thanks Oak for Riolu (he is
	confident he will earn Riolu's friendship despite its difficulty) and,
	after saying goodbye to both Oak and his father, heads out.
</p>
<p>
	II. Shadow starts his journey off with a rough start, having to pull Riolu
	along on a rope uphill. He questions if this would last the entire journey
	and eventually gets fed up with the ordeal. Untying Riolu, he asks if it
	would walk with him, but it still refuses. He asks it if it even likes him;
	negative. Handshake? Out of the question. Suddenly, Shadow spots a Pidgey
	and attempts to catch it, immediately throwing a Pok&#233;ball. The Pidgey
	comes right back out, and Shadow realizes that he has to fight it first;
	Riolu laughs at the attempt. He attempts to command Riolu, but the latter
	is too apathetic to care, instead climbing on top of a rock to spectate.
	Shadow attempts to take matters into his own hands and picks up a stone,
	throwing it in the grass; Riolu laughs at this as well. Shadow ends up
	missing and hitting a Spearow instead, who upon looking up mistakes the
	laughing Riolu for having thrown the stone. It begins attacking Riolu, who
	defends with a Force Palm. The Spearow flies into a tree, and Shadow and
	Riolu think the coast is clear, but it returns with a thousand more Spearow
	who all converge to attack. The two begin running away but are quickly
	overtaken, and a bunch of Spearow surround Riolu and begin pecking it
	mercilessly. Shadow forces his way to it and shields it from any further
	harm, continuing to run with it in his arms. He runs right off a cliff into
	a river and is swept downstream (narrowly missing a Gyarados in the water)
	where he and Riolu wash up on a river bank; while he was in the river, it
	became cloudy. However, the onslaught of Spearow continues, and Shadow runs
	more, rain starting to fall. He eventually trips and falls into a ditch. He
	drops Riolu, who lands a few feet away from him. Shadow reflects for a
	moment what he had done; Riolu was severely injured, and it was his fault.
	He pleads for Riolu to get in its Pok&#233;ball-it would be safe in there.
	He gets up, running on adrenaline, and taunts the Spearow to attack him
	instead of Riolu. Behind him, his partner sees Shadow's courage and love
	for it. Lightning begins to strike, and just before the Spearow swarm
	attacks, Riolu jumps onto Shadow's shoulder and unleashes a blast of Aura.
	The Spearow are driven away, and Shadow is unharmed. The clouds begin to
	clear, and all of a sudden Ho-Oh flies overhead. A Rainbow Wing falls from
	the sky and into Shadow's hand. The latter promises Riolu that one day they
	would meet that Pok&#233;mon. The two start heading to a Pok&#233;mon
	Center to heal.
</p>
<p>
	a) Shadow is tugging along Riolu on a rope as the latter refuses to move,
	and Shadow mutters to himself if this is going to last the entire journey.
	Eventually, he gets fed up and unties Riolu, asking it to walk with him, to
	which it refuses. He asks it if it even likes him, and it blatantly shakes
	its head. Shadow tells it that the two are stuck together anyway, and asks
	for a handshake; Riolu turns its back in refusal. Exasperated, he looks
	around and spots a Pidgey perching in some tall grass. He immediately
	throws a Pok&#233;ball at it, but it reappears almost instantly, and Shadow
	remembers that he has to battle it first. He asks Riolu to battle to it,
	but instead, it climbs onto a rock and watches. Shadow picks up a rock,
	intending to fight it himself, but the Spearow flies off. Shadow throws the
	rock anyways, which hits a different Spearow. It mistakes Riolu as being
	the one who threw the rock and begins attacking it. Doing something other
	than lazing around for the first time, Riolu fights back with a Force Palm,
	driving the Spearow into a tree which triggers a thousand more to come out
	and attack. Shadow and Riolu immediately begin running away as rain starts
	to pour down, chased by the flock, but they are two quick and quickly
	overtake Riolu. Shadow pushes his way to the center and picks up Riolu,
	protecting it and proceeding to run away. More running leads them to run
	straight off a cliff into a river, and when they resurface, they find the
	Spearow are still chasing them. Yet more running leads them to fall into a
	ditch. Shadow puts Riolu behind him and asks it to go into its
	Pok&#233;ball, and then stands in front of it and taunts the Spearow. As
	the Spearow build up a strike, lightning begins to crash down. Just before
	the flock attacks Shadow, though, Riolu jumps up and unleashes a blast of
	Aura which drives the flock away. Shadow and Riolu then realize the bond
	that they have just formed. The clouds clear-it's still daytime-and Ho-Oh,
	one of the legendary Pok&#233;mon of Kanto, flies over and drops a Rainbow
	Wing over Shadow, who picks it up. For a second, Shadow is mystified. He
	then promises Riolu that one day they would meet the Pok&#233;mon (Shadow
	doesn't know its name yet). The two then make their way to a Pok&#233;mon
	Center to heal.
</p>
<p>
	III.
	<em>
		Time fast-forwards, a lot. Shadow now has three Gym badges, and his
		bond with Riolu has strengthened immensely (although it hasn't evolved
		yet).
	</em>
	Shadow catches a Caterpie in the wild before stumbling across a
	Pok&#233;mon Center, and heads in, healing his Pok&#233;mon and calling his
	dad on one of the telephones. He gets word that Entei, one of the legendary
	Pok&#233;mon of Kanto, is near. After abruptly hanging up on his dad, he
	heads outside immediately to try to battle it. After some searching, he
	finds it in a clearing, but not before meeting Verity, a different Trainer
	who also wants to battle Entei with her Piplup. On the other side of the
	clearing is yet another trainer, Sorrel, with a Lucario who <em>also </em>
	wants to fight. The three battle Entei, but make no progress before the
	legendary Pok&#233;mon bounds away, and they all argue for a second. Sorrel
	leaves, and Shadow and Verity begin a fight before they disturb an Onyx.
	The two and their Pok&#233;mon are chased before they manage to calm the
	Onyx down. Shadow then discovers a Charmander that had been left out in the
	rain by Cross, a Trainer who believes strength is the only thing that
	matters to a Pok&#233;mon, and proceed to take it into a cave where Sorrel
	also is after Cross refuses to take it back. Charmander is treated-its
	flame very nearly went out in the rain-and the three Trainers talk about
	themselves. Sorrel explains the legend about Ho-Oh and the legendary trio
	(Entei, Raikou, and Suicune), and upon Shadow revealing the Rainbow Wing
	suggests that they all travel to Mount Tensei where Ho-Oh is said to appear
	is a Rainbow Wing is placed. Entei suddenly appears with other wild
	Pok&#233;mon and rests on a platform on the other side of the cave. Shadow
	offers to keep Charmander warm, and they all sleep until morning.
</p>
<p>
	a) Shadow is on a call with his father about how his journey is going so
	far. The latter is merely concerned about Shadow's wellbeing, and Shadow
	quickly loses his patience. Nurse Joy comes out of her back room and
	informs Shadow that Riolu has been healed; it is on top of a cart that
	Nurse Joy's Chansey is carrying. Riolu climbs up onto Shadow's shoulder and
	says hello. As they're talking, a different Trainer with a Vaporeon appears
	and talks about having battled Entei a few minutes ago. Shadow says a hasty
	goodbye to his dad and exits the Pok&#233;mon Center; other trainers exit
	as well. They're all looking for Entei. After some searching in the forest,
	Shadow sees Entei standing on top of a rock in a clearing. However, to his
	right is another trainer: Verity! Armed with a Piplup, she too wants to
	fight Entei and the two race to the clearing in hopes of being the first to
	battle. Once they make it, though, they see a third trainer, named Sorrel,
	with a Lucario on the other side of the clearing. All three of them try to
	fight Entei, but Entei disdains the attack and flees to elsewhere. Shadow
	and Verity argue, accusing each other of being the reason Entei fled, and
	the two agree to a battle. Sorrel, on the other hand, refuses to fight, and
	leaves with Lucario, telling them that it's due to rain again soon.
	Verity's Piplup's Hydro Pump misses Riolu and instead hits what was thought
	to be rocks outside of the clearing, but to both of their horror, an Onyx
	rises, maddened. Both Trainers and their Pok&#233;mon flee the scene, and
	after a long chase through a rock ravine Shadow manages to calm the Onyx
	down. True enough, it begins raining again, and Shadow and Verity decide to
	find shelter together. On the way, they encounter a Charmander sitting on a
	rock. Shadow wonders who put it there when another person, Cross, appears,
	with a Midnight Form Lycanroc. He explains that since the Charmander was
	weak, there was no sense in keeping it, and so he left it out in the rain
	to toughen it up. Shadow is disgusted by this, and Cross walks away. Verity
	notes that the fire on Charmander's tail is tiny-if it ever went out
	completely&#8230;The two resolve to find shelter, fast, and make it to a
	cave. Upon entering, they see that Sorrel had taken refuge in there as
	well. Sorrel at first becomes mad at Shadow for leaving the Charmander in
	the rain, but Verity explains the situation. Sorrel gladly agrees to heal
	the Charmander, and after feeding it medicine wraps it in cloth to keep
	warm. Shadow vouches to hold it to spread his body heat. The three begin
	discussing their pasts; Shadow and Verity are both on journeys, and Sorrel
	wants to learn more about the legendary Pok&#233;mon of Kanto. He proceeds
	to tell them both the tale of the Burned Tower, and how Ho-Oh resurrected
	them. He also gives a picture, which Shadow immediately recognizes. He
	pulls out the Rainbow Wing from his jacket pocket, and the two marvel at
	it. Sorrel explains that Ho-Oh gives the Rainbow Wing to a Trainer that it
	likes-a so-called "rainbow hero" that is destined to battle the legendary
	Pok&#233;mon-and suggests that Shadow travel to Mount Tensei, where Ho-Oh
	is said to come if a Rainbow Wing is placed. The three decide to travel to
	Mount Tensei together. Just then, Entei arrives in the cave along with some
	wild Pok&#233;mon, and takes up residence on an elevated spot in the cave,
	taking particular notice of Shadow's Rainbow Wing. The three leave it
	alone, and Sorrel says that it's going to be cold despite the existence of
	a fire. He puts his Lucario back into its Pok&#233;ball, as does Verity
	with Piplup, but Shadow explains that Riolu does not appreciate being in
	its Pok&#233;ball. The other two Pok&#233;mon hop out of their
	Pok&#233;balls as well, and they all spend the night sleeping together.
</p>
<p>
	IV. Shadow convinces Charmander to travel along with him, and the entire
	party sets off towards Mount Tensei. They begin walking to a nearby town
	but not before going for a swim. Shadow battles a Pinsir with Caterpie, and
	it evolves into Metapod. That same night, Verity sees Suicune and shares it
	with the group while they continue walking. Once they make it to the city,
	Shadow does not waste time battling. He wins against a Jigglypuff using
	Charmander, and the latter evolves to Charmeleon. Sorrel begins to research
	more about Ho-Oh at the library the following day. He finds information
	about Ho-Oh regarding its presence in the past. Shadow decides to fight
	some trainers at the local battleground while they're here and gets on a
	winning streak with Riolu. After defeating a Snorlax, Cross comes up and
	challenges Shadow, this time using an Incineroar. Shadow uses Charmeleon,
	believing that he could win through the sheer faith that Cross' training
	strategy is incorrect. However, Charmeleon is savagely beaten, and Cross
	smugly walks away. Shadow is unable to believe the loss, and openly admits
	that had he used Riolu he would have won. He runs away into the forest, the
	others chasing after him. Verity and Sorrel fall behind, but Riolu keeps
	pace. After Riolu says that it disagrees with him, Shadow says that he
	wishes that he had chosen a different starter Pok&#233;mon entirely. Riolu
	stops following him, standing in one place while Shadow walks away until it
	is out of sight. Shadow asks himself if he even needs Riolu, sitting down
	against a tree. Taking the Rainbow Wing out of his pocket, he wonders if he
	really is the rainbow hero. Marshadow appears from behind him unnoticed and
	puts him in a sleep-like trance. The Rainbow Wing falls from his hand and
	loses its color.
</p>
<p>
	a) Riolu is the first to wake up the following morning and immediately
	notices that the rain has stopped and that Entei has gone. The others start
	waking up and when Shadow awakes he sees that Charmander's tail flame is
	back to full strength. Shadow asks Charmander if it would like to go with
	him, and after a slight bit of hesitance, it agrees. Shadow puts it in a
	Pok&#233;ball. They all decide to vacate the cave, and after looking at
	Sorrel's map start heading for the nearest town. First, though, they go for
	a swim (minus Sorrel and Lucario, who stay dry sitting against a tree).
	Shadow ends up fighting a Pinsir with Caterpie, and after flinging the
	former down with a String Shot the latter evolves into Metapod. The Pinsir
	gets away, but Shadow is just happy that his Pok&#233;mon evolved. Once
	they make it inside the (unnamed) town, Shadow wastes no time going
	straight to the local battlefield, where he and Charmander face off against
	a Jigglypuff. Charmander wins and evolves to Charmeleon while running back
	to Shadow. The next day, they all head towards the library, where Sorrel
	begins researching more about Ho-Oh and the rainbow hero prophecy. He
	uncovers more information about the legendary Pok&#233;mon: long ago, Ho-Oh
	watched over the works of people and Pok&#233;mon, and everyone was given
	energy via an aura of happiness. However, a heart of evil touched the
	Rainbow Wing, and its color vanished. Shadow heads back to the battlefield.
	After defeating a Snorlax, Cross comes up and challenges him, saying that
	he heard a rumor that Shadow was using Charmander [<em>sic</em>]. When
	Shadow sends out Charmeleon, Cross maintains that weak Pok&#233;mon who
	evolve are still weak. Shadow is sure that he will win as he is up against
	incorrectly-trained Pok&#233;mon. Cross uses Incineroar, and Shadow uses
	Charmeleon-Cross comments that useless Pok&#233;mon that evolve are still
	useless. Despite Shadow's and Charmeleon's tenacity, Charmeleon is badly
	defeated, and Cross proceeds to insult Shadow, citing that he relied on
	cheap friendship and tried to use moves he couldn't use. Shadow has no
	retort. He can't believe his loss and is extremely upset despite Verity's
	and Sorrel's attempts to console him. He openly admits that he would have
	won had he used Riolu instead, and runs away into the forest when Sorrel
	calls him out on being no better than Cross if that was his mindset. The
	others chase him, but Riolu is the only one who keeps pace; Verity and
	Sorrel are left behind. Eventually, Shadow slows to a walk, still walking
	away, and declares the two losers. He asks if Riolu agrees with him, to
	which it says no. Shadow says that he wishes that he had chosen Bulbasaur
	or Squirtle instead. Riolu stops following Shadow and stands while the
	latter continues walking away until it is out of sight. When Shadow glances
	back, it is completely gone. Sitting down against a tree, he questions
	whether or not he even needs Riolu, and sits down against a tree. He takes
	out the Rainbow Wing and says to Ho-Oh that he thought he was the rainbow
	hero. Marshadow slowly appears from behind Shadow (he doesn't notice it)
	and possesses him, giving his eyes a purple glow and putting him into a
	sleep-like state. The Rainbow Wing falls out of Shadow's hand and is
	corrupted, losing its color.
</p>
<p>
	V. <em>(Dream)</em> Shadow wakes up in his room; his alarm clock did not
	work, and he had overslept. He quickly gets dressed in a full panic, not
	wanting to be late for the first day of school, and heads out towards
	Professor Oak's class. Once he makes it there, he says hello to Oak, who is
	watering some bushes. Oak comments that out of the four students who were
	late, he was the latest, and tells him to head to class. Once inside,
	Verity and Sorrel berate him, the former calling him out for his lateness
	and the latter on not doing the homework. Shadow tries to listen to the
	lesson about rainbows but loses his focus as he sees a flicker of something
	blue underneath his desk; his classmates Verity and Sorrel call him weird.
	He also sees Ho-Oh outside, but after doing a double take, it's just a
	plane. Once class ends, Shadow heads to the rooftop and looks outside of
	the chain fence gate. Verity and Sorrel come up; the former asks if the
	view would ever get boring and the latter asks what is on his mind. Shadow
	asks what's "way out there". Sorrel replies that it's the forest, a town,
	more forest, another town, and then the sea; he had never really given it
	any thought. Verity says that it's just more of the same. Shadow talks
	about wanting to leave the school, and Verity and Sorrel chime in, citing
	different advantages: no school, freedom, friends, etc. Shadow says that he
	will always have his buddy but stops himself; his buddy no longer exists.
	The same blue flicker appears on Shadow's shoulder, and suddenly he starts
	crying; Verity and Sorrel tell him to pull himself together. When Shadow
	looks up, they are both gone, but behind him is a hazy shape of his buddy.
	Running after it, Shadow finds himself in a plaza, still going. He comments
	that they used to run like this all the time, but still can't remember his
	partner's name. The ground starts to crumble, and Shadow jumps and catches
	it in his arms, remembering its name, Riolu. Suddenly, they begin falling
	from the sky above a meadow. When they hit the ground, Shadow wakes up
	underneath the tree; the first thing he sees is Riolu in front of him. He
	immediately breaks down crying and hugs Riolu, saying that it was all his
	fault. Beside him, the Rainbow Wing regains its color. Verity asks if
	Shadow even knew how long they'd been searching for him, and Sorrel
	lectures him, saying that you cannot expect to win every battle and that
	losing is how you grow stronger. They then leave to make camp somewhere
	else.
</p>
<p>
	a) Shadow is sleeping in bed, and in a dream throws his alarm clock,
	disabling it. He then wakes up and realizes just how late he is to the
	first day of school. He quickly gets dressed in a full panic, stopping for
	a second to appreciate the poster on his wall depicting three
	snazzy-looking cars, and heads outside of his room to tell his father about
	the ordeal. The former runs over to the school to avoid being late. Once
	Shadow makes it there, he sees Professor Oak, his teacher, outside giving
	water to bushes. After saying hello, Oak comments that out of the four
	students late, he was the latest. Shadow proceeds to his first class, where
	he attempts to focus on the current lesson: rainbows. However, he feels
	that something is missing in his day, and catches a glimpse of something
	blue below his desk. He looks over, but sees nothing; instead, his
	classmates Verity and Sorrel call him weird. Shadow also thinks he sees
	Ho-Oh in the skies, but upon closer inspection, it's just a plane. Once the
	class is over, Shadow walks up to the rooftop and stares outside of the
	chain link fence for a long time. Verity and Sorrel come up, Verity asking
	if Shadow ever got bored of the view. Shadow asks them what is beyond the
	school. Sorrel responds by saying there's forest, and then a town, and then
	more forest and another town; beyond that is the sea. Verity says that it's
	just more of the same after that. Shadow tells them that he wants to
	explore what's out there. Verity and Sorrel chime in; no school, staying
	up, absolute freedom&#8230; Shadow says that he always has his buddy, but
	stops himself when he realizes that his "buddy" no longer exists. He sees a
	vision of his partner on his shoulder and begins to cry. His friends tell
	him to pull himself together, but when Shadow looks back up, they're gone.
	Behind him, he sees that same figure, hazy but there. He begins to run
	towards it, and he suddenly finds himself running along a plaza. He says
	that they used to run like this all the time. The ground starts crumbling
	into chunks and falling into the void, and Shadow tries to catch up. He
	jumps and catches his partner, remembering its name, Riolu. Suddenly, the
	two are transported to the skies above a meadow and fall to the ground in
	terror. When Shadow hits the ground, he wakes up in the waking world, still
	underneath the tree. He immediately sees Riolu in front of him and hugs it,
	crying and saying that it was all his fault. Beside him, the Rainbow Wing
	regains its color. Verity asks Shadow if he had any idea how long they'd
	been searching for him, and Sorrel lectures him, saying that you cannot
	expect to win every battle and that it's the losses that you grow strong
	from, but that's just his opinion. Shadow gets up, and the group goes
	elsewhere in the forest.
</p>
<p>
	VI. The group makes camp in a clearing of trees and Shadow starts
	explaining his dream. Verity is in disbelief at the concept of a world
	without Pok&#233;mon, but Sorrel has a different take on it: it's not
	impossible for Pok&#233;mon to leave us. He goes on to talk about a point
	in his childhood when his parents were frequently away, and so the family
	Luxray took care of him. One day, however, Sorrel injures himself against a
	tree out in the cold snow by accident. Luxray bounds over and curls up next
	to him to stop him from freezing. When morning comes, Luxray is frozen
	solid; it died smiling. The rescue team finds Sorrel and takes him away;
	the latter is screaming out Luxray's name in tears as he is dragged away.
	Present-day Sorrel explains that after that, he was reluctant to make
	friends with any Pok&#233;mon until he met his Lucario. Marshadow suddenly
	appears behind Shadow and is noticed, unlike its other appearances. Riolu
	gets agitated and fires an Aura Sphere at the spot where Marshadow was, but
	it had already rescinded into Shadow's shadow; instead, Riolu hits the
	tree, triggering a group of Primape to come down. The Primape get in a
	circle and begin throwing the group in the air until Sorrel advises Shadow
	to use Metapod to calm them. Shadow gets off and releases the Pok&#233;mon,
	holding it and having it use String Shot to ensnare the Primape. Once they
	are no longer a threat, the group dismounts and runs away until they reach
	a stream. After calming down, Verity calls upon her Lapras, and they use it
	to travel downstream.
</p>
<p>
	a) The group makes a fire in a circular clearing of trees; a thin fog has
	rolled in, and it is still nighttime. Shadow is explaining the dream that
	he had, the others listening in closely. Verity is in shock at the very
	concept of a world without Pok&#233;mon. Sorrel, on the other hand, has a
	different perspective: it is possible for Pok&#233;mon to leave us. He
	describes a time in his early childhood: His parents were away most of the
	time, so the family Luxray took care of Sorrel. One day, however, Sorrel
	hurt himself outside in a blizzard and quickly started freezing. Luxray
	bounded across and laid down with him in the center to keep him from doing
	so. In the morning, when the blizzard was gone, Luxray was frozen solid; it
	had died smiling. A rescue team found Sorrel with Luxray, and as they
	carried him away, he screamed his protector's name. Afterwards, Sorrel was
	reluctant to make friends with any Pok&#233;mon, until he found Lucario.
	Shadow and Verity are somber after hearing the tale and offer their
	condolences. Meanwhile, Marshadow slowly appears from Shadow's shadow, but
	this time they spot it. Riolu is instantly aggressive and fires an Aura
	Sphere at Marshadow's location, but it rescinds long before it would have
	hit. Instead, the Aura Sphere hits the tree and shakes it. A group of
	Primape come down from the branches and quickly gather the group in a
	circle, repeatedly launching them in the air. Sorrel advises Shadow to use
	Metapod, as fighting back would only make them madder. Shadow manages to
	dismount the circle of Primape and takes out Metapod; he holds it and has
	it use String Shot, running around the ring. The aggressors are ensnared,
	and everyone dismounts before they can attack again. They quickly reach a
	stream, and Verity gets out her Lapras. They all board Lapras and begin
	sailing downstream.
</p>
<p>
	VII. The following morning (they had spent the entire night on Lapras'
	back), the group continues heading towards Mount Tensei. Eventually, they
	reach a cliff that shows a good view of the mountain before they hear a
	scream. Looking over to his left, Shadow spots a pink Butterfree being
	attacked by a Fearow and decides to save it. He throws his own Butterfree
	out of its Pok&#233;ball, and after a quick Gust, the Fearow is driven
	away. The two Butterfree hug, Verity pointing out that the pink one must be
	female. The pink Butterfree parts ways and the group continues. After
	coming to a hilltop close to Mount Tensei, the rainbow wing suddenly glows,
	and a beam of light goes directly to the mountain. Once it becomes evening,
	they reunite with the pink Butterfree; a bunch of the species is traveling
	across the landscape. Sorrel says that it's mating season for them right
	now. Shadow takes out his own Butterfree, and almost immediately the pink
	Butterfree flies over. Shadow cheers on their relationship. However, Verity
	explains the caveat: If Butterfree went with its partner, it would mean
	goodbye to Shadow. The latter suddenly becomes distraught, and Sorrel tells
	him that it's his decision. Butterfree flies down, and Shadow asks it if it
	wants to go, to which Butterfree responds by flying behind his back. After
	some hesitation, Shadow says that it should go with the pink Butterfree and
	that if they don't, they will be left behind. As the blue one flies over to
	be with the other, Shadow says that they are both really great (with a
	slight pause between the "both" and "really") and that they should take
	care of each other. As they wave goodbye, Shadow and his Butterfree start
	crying profusely. It continues until the sun has set and no Butterfree are
	visible. Shadow comments that he is glad that he met Butterfree and that
	even though they said goodbye, they are still good friends. Sorrel says
	that while it is true that people raise Pok&#233;mon, Pok&#233;mon live
	their own lives. Suddenly, thunder crashes down behind them. They look
	around to see Raikou, another legendary Pok&#233;mon, standing and watching
	them. Another bolt of lightning crashes down, and Raikou is gone just as
	quickly as it appeared.
</p>
<p>
	a) The group is still going downstream on Lapras' back when day breaks, but
	they eventually disembark and continue walking. As they are going through a
	forest and are about to reach a cliff, however, they hear a Pok&#233;mon
	scream off to the left. After looking, they identify it as a pink
	Butterfree who is being hunted by a Fearow. Shadow immediately goes to
	protect it, unleashing his own Butterfree and having it chase the Fearow
	away with Gust. When the belligerent flees, the two Butterfree stop for a
	second, the pink one thanking the other. Sorrel points out that the pink
	one is pink, as opposed to blue, and Verity concludes that it must be
	female. The pink Butterfree flies off. Once they are at the edge of the
	cliff, the Rainbow Wing begins glowing. Shadow takes it out of his pocket,
	and it lights a visible beam all the way to a mountain that isn't too far
	away: Mount Tensei. They're in front of another cliff when Shadow spots a
	swarm of Butterfree flying together in the distance. Sorrel comments that
	it's mating season for the Butterfree right now. Shadow takes out his own
	Butterfree, and within a few seconds, the pink one from before flies down
	to greet them. Shadow encourages their relationship, saying that they are
	awesome together, but Verity warns that should the two Butterfree go off
	together, it would be goodbye. Shadow becomes distraught at the concept of
	saying goodbye, and Sorrel states that in the end, it is his decision.
	Butterfree itself flies down to Shadow, who asks it if it wants to go.
	Butterfree responds after hesitation by flying behind his back. Shadow says
	that it should go with the other Butterfree and that if they don't go now,
	they will be left behind (in the background, the Butterfree swarm has
	continued flying some distance). As his Butterfree goes to be with the pink
	one, Shadow praises them, saying that they are both really great
	Pok&#233;mon (with a slight pause between "both" and "really"). As they
	begin waving goodbye to each other, Shadow and Butterfree both start crying
	profusely. They continue until the swarm has left; long after the sun has
	set. Shadow says that he is glad to have met Butterfree and that even
	though it's not here, they are still good friends. Sorrel comments that
	though people raise Pok&#233;mon, Pok&#233;mon live their own lives.
	Suddenly, a bolt of lightning crashes down behind the group. Turning
	around, they witness Raikou, the third of the legendary trio, standing on
	top of a rock looking down at them. With another flash of lightning, Raikou
	is gone as soon as it appeared. Their resolve strengthened, the group
	pushes forward to reach Mount Tensei.
</p>
<p>
	VIII. The group is at the base of Mount Tensei, walking along through thick
	fog. Many Pok&#233;mon are scattered around, looking agitated, and Verity
	comments about it. Bonji suddenly says that it's because they want to meet
	Ho-Oh and receive its power. Bonji gets down from the rock he was on and
	starts sniffing the air, catching a faint scent of Ho-Oh. Shadow pulls out
	the Rainbow Wing and Bonji is amazed. Verity is surprised that he knows of
	it, and Sorrel recognizes him as being the author of the book in the
	libray. Bonji says his name, explaining that for the past 20 years he's
	been on a quest, searching for Ho-Oh being a part of his research. He
	elaborates that he's pulled data from many places, and that the data all
	shows Mount Tensei to be the place of Ho-Oh's next appearance. They agree
	to travel together to the summit, and Bonji comments that the Rainbow
	Wing's shine is the shine of youth and that it's almost too beautiful for
	him to look upon. As they are walking, Bonji says that it's probably thanks
	in large part to the Rainbow Wing that the group has come across Entei,
	Raikou, and Suicune. He goes on to say that Ho-Oh wants to know if there is
	a young person suitable enough to be the Rainbow Hero, which means that
	there may be someone guiding Shadow from the shadows. Shadow recalls seeing
	one, and Bonji says that it's most likely the extremely rare Pok&#233;mon
	Marshadow. Marshadow is a guide from the shadows, and that when the Rainbow
	Wing's color fades, it seals it back up and makes it right. The fog has
	been getting thinner as they've been walking uphill, and suddenly the
	Rainbow Wing glows; when Shadow takes it out it lights a direct beam of
	light to a crystal rock at the summit. Bonji prophesizes that when a
	Rainbow Flower blooms upon Rainbow Rock, Ho-Oh shall appear, and Shadow is
	overexcited, running ahead. / When the group makes it to the summit, they
	find that more Pok&#233;mon are standing on ledges, waiting. There is a
	circular area fit for a battlefield, and in front of them is the Rainbow
	Rock. Sorrel says that that's where Shadow should place the Rainbow Wing,
	and the latter runs over to plant it. However, Incineroar stops him, using
	Throat Chop in front of him to knock him back. Cross appears from behind
	the rock and demands the Rainbow Wing, saying that the Trainer who gets to
	battle Ho-Oh is the strongest, and that he is the strongest. Sorrel defies
	that, saying that that's not how it works, and Verity chimes in, saying
	that the one to battle Ho-Oh is the one chosen by it. Cross calls them
	soft, using the jingle "might makes right and that's it". Answering
	Shadow's questions, he declared weak people trash, and people that lose
	worse than trash. The Rainbow Wing suddenly glows, and Marshadow appears
	from Shadow's shadow and jumps on top of a ledge. Shadow recognizes it as
	being Marshadow; Cross is satisfied to meet the guardian from the shadows;
	Sorrel says that it's the Pok&#233;mon they saw that night; and Verity
	declares it cute. Bonji says that its only purpose is to observe the
	proceedings.
</p>
<p>
	IX. Shadow releases Charmeleon from its Pok&#233;ball to battle Cross'
	Incineroar. The latter immediately starts with Flamethrower, which
	Charmeleon dodges. Charmeleon retaliates with Slash, which lands a direct
	hit. Incineroar uses Throat Chop, and Charmeleon hops around unharmed.
	Charmeleon uses Slash yet again, and the two are locked in a power contest.
	Incineroar then uses Flamethrower, and Charmeleon is caught directly,
	blocking the flames. While in the Flamethrower, however, it evolves into
	Charizard. Cross doesn't care, saying that weak Pok&#233;mon who evolve are
	still weak. He continues with Throat Chop and Charizard uses Slash; they
	end up hitting each other. Incineroar uses Flamethrower, and Charizard
	flies around to dodge it. Charizard uses Dragon Rage and it's a direct hit.
	Shadow commands Charizard to build up its power to end it with a big
	attack. Incineroar continues the onslaught with Fire Fang, and Charizard
	dodges. While its in the air, Incineroar jumps and grabs it to bring it
	down. Before it hits the ground, Charizard uses Seismic Toss and flings
	Incineroar across the stage. Cross aims to end the fight with Flamethrower;
	Charizard does the same. It's a fire contest, but Charizard's flame powers
	into a fully-fledged fireball and Incineroar loses, unable to battle. Cross
	gets on his knees and returns Incineroar. Shadow takes out the Rainbow Wing
	and walks over to the Rainbow Walk, but after he walks by Cross the latter
	says that he saw Ho-Oh too. Cross continues, saying that it didn't give him
	the Rainbow Wing even after he's done everything to become the strongest.
	He asks why it had to be Shadow, and that if Ho-Oh doesn't consider him the
	strongest, he'll crush it. Shadow intervenes, saying that he wants to get
	stronger as well, but explains that he only got this far with the help of
	his friends, so he knows that it's not just about strength. Cross asks him
	what he even battles for, and Shadow responds that it's because he wants to
	make friends. Cross doesn't reply, instead running at Shadow and wrestling
	the Rainbow Wing away from him. He climbs up to the top of Rainbow Rock,
	the Rainbow Wing losing its color as he holds it, and places it where it
	should be. A dark beam appears from the Rainbow Rock and clouds flood the
	sky. The ground turns corrupt and purple as well. Bonji comments that the
	Rainbow Wing loses its color when touched by one with an evil heart.
	Marshadow appears from the shadows and grabs Cross, tossing him aside;
	Lycanroc catches him. Bonji continues unfolding the prophecy, saying that
	Marshadow seals it back up and makes it right.
</p>
<p>
	X. Marshadow picks up the Rainbow Wing while Cross vows to pound it as
	well. Lycanroc uses Crush Claw, but before it makes it Marshadow fires a
	beam of darkness towards it; Lycanroc's eyes turn purple and it turns
	around, mind-controlled. It starts attacking Cross, who runs away from it.
	Just before a ball of energy hits Cross, Charizard flies in front of him,
	taking the blow. Verity asks if he sees it now, that Charizard never forgot
	that he was once its trainer. Shadow comments that it's just like Charizard
	to be awesome. Meanwhile, Marshadow fires more dark beams of light all
	around, mind-controlling every Pok&#233;mon around except for the group's.
	An Electabuzz fires a Thunderbolt towards Cross and Charizard-the two jump
	away in response-and a Pidgeotto flies towards Bonji, Sorrel, and Shadow;
	Sorrel's Lucario knocks it away. Bonji says that it looks as if Marshadow
	wants to control the group as well, and that Ho-Oh will never appear now
	that it's come to this. At Marshadow's command, a group of Pok&#233;mon
	fire attacks at the group, forcing them to retreat. Bonji says that Shadow
	has got to get the Rainbow Wing back; Marshadow is getting its power from
	it, and only Shadow can get it back. Sorrel and Verity help defend Shadow
	while the latter starts making his way to Marshadow. Charizard
	Flamethrowers a Graveller and Magmar; Piplup uses Hydro Pump against a
	Pidgeotto; Charizard body slams an Arbok; Shadow runs on top of a charging
	Ryhorn; Sorrel's Lucario uses Bone Rush to block a Graveller as well as the
	Ryhorn; and just before it fires a Stone Edge Cross tackles Lycanroc,
	pinning it down. Lycanroc proceeds to bite Cross' arm; Cross remembers that
	it bit him the day they met as well. He commands Lycanroc to remember as
	well, and Lycanroc is lifted of its trance. Shadow makes it to Marshadow
	and demands that it give him the Rainbow Wing; it responds by leaping down
	from the rock and firing dark balls of energy at Lucario. Lucario
	retaliates by dodging the first two and hitting the third one back with a
	Bone Rush; Marshadow deflects it. The two engage in close combat, Lucario
	still having a Bone Rush, but Marshadow lands a blow and Lucario is knocked
	back. Behind the two, Sorrel's Lucario is hit, but before the opposing
	Pok&#233;mon can do more damage Cross steps in with Lycanroc and counters
	an incoming fireball. However, a Nidoqueen and Nidoking both use Rock
	Throw, attacking the party with boulders. The defenders run away to avoid
	getting crushed. An Arbok wraps around Charizard's neck, incapacitating it.
	Meanwhile, Lucario is hit again with one of Marshadow's attacks, but Shadow
	is anything but deterred; Lucario keeps fighting. Marshadow begins glowing,
	its previously grey hair and eyebrows becoming green and red, respectively,
	and unleashes a flurry of energy balls. Lucario attempts to dodge them but
	is hit by one and subsequently all the others. Shadow responds immediately
	by having Lucario use Aura Sphere mid-air; Marshadow jumps in a kicking
	position. It is a power standoff, but Marshadow wins and Lucario is
	directly hit. An explosion occurs from the energy exertion, knocking both
	Shadow and the rest of the party back.
</p>
<p>
	XI. Shadow immediately gets back up to see Lucario lying on the ground a
	few feet away and runs toward it; while he does so Marshadow stops glowing
	and stumbles for a second. As Shadow crouches down, he sees that the
	mind-controlled Pok&#233;mon are advancing on him; he picks up Lucario and
	runs away from them until he reaches the edge of a ledge. Turning back, he
	sees his opponents all lines up, ready to strike. Shadow attempts to run
	away but the Nidoqueen fires a Flamethrower at him and hits him directly.
	The others try to advance and defend him but are suppressed by other
	enslaved Pok&#233;mon; Shadow is all on his own. When the dust from the
	impact clears, Shadow is on the ground a few feet away from Lucario; the
	two begin crawling towards each other. Out of the corner of his eye he sees
	the other Pok&#233;mon continuing to encroach, and takes Lucario's
	Pok&#233;ball and rolls it over to it, pleading for it to get inside. He
	says that he knows it can't stand being inside Pok&#233;balls, but it would
	be protected. The other Pok&#233;mon start charging an attack, and Shadow
	stand up to face them. He turns his cap around and says in perfect clarity,
	"Now you look. I don't think you know who you're dealing with. I'm Shadow,
	from Pallet Town, and I'm gonna be the world's&#8230;greatest Pok&#233;mon
	master! Mess with me and you're gonna lose!" Immediately as he says the
	last word the Pok&#233;mon fire, and Lucario runs to protect him. Shadow
	sees this and stops it, instead burying it in his arms to protect it. He
	lets out a scream as the blast hits, and he is knocked to the ground,
	Lucario next to him. He asks why Lucario won't get in its Pok&#233;ball,
	and his partner replies in English, "It's because&#8230;It's because I
	always want&#8230;to be with you." The other Pok&#233;mon charge one final
	shot, and Shadow forces Lucario into its Pok&#233;ball. Holding the
	Pok&#233;ball tightly to his chest, Shadow is hit by the attack. An
	explosion ensues, so great that it is visible from several mountains away.
	The rest of the party including Cross gathers to watch, and Charizard
	flings the Arbok off its neck. When the smoke clears, Lucario's
	Pok&#233;ball rolls away and Shadow's hat lands on top of it. When Lucario
	comes out of the Pok&#233;ball, the hat is on top of it. In front of it is
	Shadow's body, transparent with pure energy irradiating from it. The
	Rainbow Wing begins to disintegrate in Marshadow's hand. Lucario takes the
	hat and attempts to place it on Shadow's head, but as it puts it down the
	body fades away into nothingness; the Rainbow Wing completely disintegrates
	as well. When the last sparkles have disappeared Lucario takes the hat and
	buries it into its face, crying out. A massive blast of Aura engulfs
	everything on top of the mountain; it is so strong that the clouds fade and
	reveal a blue sky. When the smoke disappears, the opposing Pok&#233;mon are
	no longer mind-controlled. Everybody focuses on Lucario, who is crying into
	the hat. It lets out a shout that reaches into the heavens.
</p>
<p>
	XII. Shadow awakens where he was hit by the final blast, but one thing is
	severely different: the entire world, himself included, is greyscale. He
	gets up and asks where everybody is. He hears Lucario crying behind him and
	turns around. He takes a step in its direction, and suddenly the entire
	world changes: he is now standing in a color-filled grassy plain at sunset,
	though he himself is still greyscale. In the waking world, particles begin
	to gather where Shadow's body was. Shadow hears Lucario again and starts
	running in its direction; the landscape changes again, the sky now being
	grey and the ground now being an endless grass plain. There are more
	particles where Shadow's body was, and they begin to move around more
	actively. As Shadow is running he chuckles a little, commenting that they
	used to run like this all the time. The plain suddenly is filled with
	flowers as a small beam of light opens amid the particles. As Shadow
	continues running the sky changes to a blue color, and he starts running on
	top of water. The particles become more fantastic and the beam enlarges to
	create a portal; Lucario drops the hat as it stares in amazement. Shadow is
	now running through a rainbow of colors as Lucario jumps into the portal;
	it appears in the sky in Shadow's reality as Shadow returns to running on
	water. Shadow jumps to meet Lucario and the two hug mid-air; once they
	connect Shadow's body becomes color again. The light in the waking world
	becomes dazzlingly bright, and when it fades, Shadow is alive, standing
	with Lucario. Verity and Sorrel run over to meet Shadow, and Sorrel
	comments that he's alright. Charizard also lets out a yell. Suddenly,
	particles begin gathering in Shadow's hand and the Rainbow Wing is
	reformed; the Rainbow Rock as well as the floor also return to a normal
	color. Bonji repeats that when a Rainbow Flower blooms on Rainbow Rock,
	Ho-Oh shall appear, and urges Shadow onward. Shadow climbs to the top of
	Rainbow Rock and deposits the feather; when he does so a brief flash of
	rainbow-colored light beams into the sky and a rainbow forms, Rainbow Rock
	being one of its bases. On the other end of the rainbow, Ho-Oh is flying
	towards them. Bonji continues speaking, now saying that the one who is
	guided by the Rainbow Wing may meet Ho-Oh and become the rainbow hero.
	Ho-Oh flies around in circles around the group, an aurora appearing that
	washes light onto them. Everyone's injuries are healed, and their power
	strengthened. Verity comments that it looks like everyone is healthy again,
	and Bonji chimes in, saying that it's the power of Ho-Oh. Meanwhile, Shadow
	nods to Lucario and yells out to Ho-Oh, "Let's have a battle!" The
	legendary bird tips its head and takes flight, Shadow and Lucario running
	over to take their place in the battlefield. Lucario and Ho-Oh engage in
	heated battle, which continues until long in the night. (No winner is
	declared.)
</p>
<p>
	XIII. The group arrives at the nearest Pok&#233;mon Center and Shadow goes
	to heal Lucario. Nurse Joy asks who they battled this time, and Shadow
	responds with Ho-Oh. Nurse Joy says that that's nice until she realizes
	what he just said; Shadow laughs in response. Outside the Pok&#233;mon
	Center, the group says goodbye to Cross, who vows to battle Shadow again.
	Cross tells him not to lose to anyone before then before walking off. / At
	a four-way crossroads, the group dissolves itself. Sorrel says that he'll
	be going to learn about the legends of Articuno, Zapdos, and Moltres.
	Verity plans to go and see her mom again, and Shadow says that he'll go his
	own way, working to become a Pok&#233;mon master. Sorrel hopes that they
	will meet again one day, and the three say in unison, "Then we'll have a
	battle!" before walking their own separate ways.
</p>
<p>
	XIV. EPILOGUE: Shadow and Lucario are sitting against a tree on top of a
	hill. Shadow says, "Let's go, Lucario!" and the two run into the distance
	as a narrator begins speaking: "The always-fascinating world of
	Pok&#233;mon, the most diverse and unusual creatures on the planet! They
	can be found up in the sky, under the sea, in forests, and living in towns.
	One can see Pok&#233;mon in every corner of the world! People and
	Pok&#233;mon forming all kinds of bonds and living harmoniously in a world
	made just for them! This young man, Shadow, from Pallet Town, together with
	his partner Lucario, continues to work toward his goal of becoming a
	Pok&#233;mon master! As many Pok&#233;mon as there are, well, our hero has
	just as many dreams to follow and just as many adventures to come!"
</p>
