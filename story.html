	I. Shadow wakes up late to go to Professor Oak's lab to pick out a starter
	Pok&#233;mon. He realizes that the three starter Pok&#233;mon have already
	been chosen and is stuck with a Riolu, who is hesitant to trust him.
	Nonetheless, the two depart on their journey.
</p>
<p>
	a) Shadow is sleeping in bed, and in a dream throws his alarm clock,
	disabling it. He then wakes up and realizes just how late he is to the
	ceremony. He quickly gets dressed in a full panic, stopping for a second to
	appreciate the poster on his wall depicting the three starter Pok&#233;mon,
	and heads outside of his room to tell his father about the ordeal. The two
	immediately head outside and hurry over to Professor Oak's lab. Once Shadow
	makes it there, he sees Oak outside giving water to an Oddish and
	Bellsprout. After saying hello, Oak recognizes him as being the fourth
	trainer of the day to receive a starter Pok&#233;mon. (Shadow is
	unbeknownst that the regular starter Pok&#233;mon are all unavailable.)
	Heading up the stairs to the central area, Shadow explains that he wants to
	pick a Charmander, but Oak tells him that it was already taken. He counters
	with Bulbasaur; same response. No luck with Squirtle. Shadow asks Oak what
	he could then do; would he start his journey without a Pok&#233;mon? The
	latter responds that he has one last Pok&#233;mon, but that is
	was&#8230;different. Shadow for the first time notices a Riolu standing on
	the balcony above them, and is quick to ask if that was the Pok&#233;mon
	Oak was referring to. Oak confirms, and Shadow immediately climbs up the
	stairs to greet his soon-to-be partner. The Riolu is hesitant to even say
	hello, however, and Shadow is forced to chase it around before they end up
	before Oak. He hands Shadow Riolu's Pok&#233;ball but explains the caveat
	that this Riolu hates being inside its Pok&#233;ball. Nonetheless, Shadow
	attempts to coax it inside but instead gets a laugh out of Riolu as the
	latter slaps its Pok&#233;ball into Shadow's face. Shadow mutters to
	himself what he would do with Riolu as they all prepare for Shadow to
	leave. Shadow thanks Oak for Riolu (he is confident he will earn Riolu's
	friendship despite its difficulty) and, after saying goodbye to both Oak
	and his father, heads out.
</p>
<p>
	II. On his journey, Shadow slowly begins to bond with Riolu. A Spearow
	swarm attacks and Shadow valiantly defends his partner from them. Riolu
	realizes the extent to which Shadow cares for him, and together they beat
	the Spearow swarm, marking the start of their actual friendship.
</p>
<p>
	a) Shadow is tugging along Riolu on a rope as the latter refuses to move,
	and Shadow mutters to himself if this is going to last the entire journey.
	Eventually, he gets fed up and unties Riolu, asking it to walk with him, to
	which it refuses. Exasperated, he looks around and spots a Pidgey perching
	in some tall grass. He immediately throws a Pok&#233;ball at it, but it
	reappears almost instantly, and Shadow remembers that he has to battle it
	first. He asks Riolu to battle to it, but instead, it climbs onto a rock
	and watches. Shadow picks up a rock, intending to fight it himself, but the
	Spearow flies off. Shadow throws the rock anyways, which hits a different
	Spearow. It mistakes Riolu as being the one who threw the rock and begins
	attacking it. Doing something other than lazing around for the first time,
	Riolu fights back with a Force Palm, driving the Spearow into a tree which
	triggers a thousand more to come out and attack. Shadow and Riolu
	immediately begin running away as rain starts to pour down, chased by the
	flock, but they are two quick and quickly overtake Riolu. Shadow pushes his
	way to the center and picks up Riolu, protecting it and proceeding to run
	away. More running leads them to run straight off a cliff into a river, and
	when they resurface, they find the Spearow are still chasing them. Even
	more running leads them to fall into a ditch. Shadow puts Riolu behind him
	and asks it to go into its Pok&#233;ball, and then stands in front of it
	and taunts the Spearow. Just before the flock attacks Shadow, though, Riolu
	jumps up and uses an Aura Sphere (This Riolu is one of the few who know the
	move before evolving), which drives the flock away. Shadow and Riolu then
	realize the bond that they have just formed. The clouds clear-it's still
	daytime-and Ho-Oh, one of the legendary Pok&#233;mon of Kanto, flies over
	and drops a Rainbow Wing over Shadow, who picks it up. For a second, Shadow
	is mystified. He then promises Riolu that one day they would meet the
	Pok&#233;mon (Shadow doesn't know its name yet). The two then make their
	way to a Pok&#233;mon center to heal.
</p>
<p>
	III.
	<em>
		Time fast-forwards, a lot. Shadow now has three Gym badges, and his
		bond with Riolu has strengthened immensely (although it hasn't evolved
		yet).
	</em>
	Shadow catches a Caterpie in the wild before stumbling across a
	Pok&#233;mon Center, and heads in, healing his Pok&#233;mon and calling his
	dad on one of the telephones. He gets word that Entei, one of the legendary
	Pok&#233;mon of Kanto, is near. After abruptly hanging up on his dad, he
	heads outside immediately to try to battle it. After some searching, he
	finds it in a clearing, but not before meeting Verity, a different Trainer
	who also wants to battle Entei with her Piplup. On the other side of the
	clearing is yet another trainer, Sorrel, with a Lucario who <em>also </em>
	wants to fight. The three battle Entei, but make no progress before the
	legendary Pok&#233;mon bounds away, and they all argue for a second. Sorrel
	leaves, and Shadow and Verity begin a fight before they disturb an Onyx.
	The two and their Pok&#233;mon are chased before they manage to calm the
	Onyx down. Shadow then discovers a Charmander that had been left out in the
	rain by Cross, a Trainer who believes strength is the only thing that
	matters to a Pok&#233;mon, and proceed to take it into a cave where Sorrel
	also is after Cross refuses to take it back. Charmander is treated-its
	flame very nearly went out in the rain-and the three Trainers talk about
	themselves. Sorrel explains the legend about Ho-Oh and the legendary trio
	(Entei, Raikou, and Suicune), and upon Shadow revealing the Rainbow Wing
	suggests that they all travel to Mount Tensei where Ho-Oh is said to appear
	is a Rainbow Wing is placed. Entei suddenly appears with other wild
	Pok&#233;mon and rests on a platform on the other side of the cave. Shadow
	offers to keep Charmander warm, and they all sleep until morning.
</p>
<p>
	a) Shadow is on a call with his father about how his journey is going so
	far. The latter is merely concerned about Shadow's wellbeing, and Shadow
	quickly loses his patience. Nurse Joy comes out of her back room and
	informs Shadow that Riolu has been healed; it is on top of a cart that
	Nurse Joy's Chansey is carrying. Riolu climbs up onto Shadow's shoulder and
	says hello. As they're talking, a different Trainer with a Vaporeon appears
	and talks about having battled Entei a few minutes ago. Shadow says a hasty
	goodbye to his dad and exits the Pok&#233;mon Center; other trainers exit
	as well. They're all looking for Entei. After some searching in the forest,
	Shadow sees Entei standing on top of a rock in a clearing. However, to his
	right is another trainer: Verity! Armed with a Piplup, she too wants to
	fight Entei and the two race to the clearing in hopes of being the first to
	battle. Once they make it, though, they see a third trainer, named Sorrel,
	with a Lucario on the other side of the clearing. All three of them try to
	fight Entei, but Entei disdains the attack and flees to elsewhere. Shadow
	and Verity argue, accusing each other of being the reason Entei fled, and
	the two agree to a battle. Sorrel, on the other hand, refuses to fight, and
	leaves with Lucario, telling them that it's due to rain again soon.
	Verity's Piplup's Hydro Pump misses Riolu and instead hits what was thought
	to be rocks outside of the clearing, but to both of their horror, an Onyx
	rises, maddened. Both Trainers and their Pok&#233;mon flee the scene, and
	after a long chase through a rock ravine Shadow manages to calm the Onyx
	down. True enough, it begins raining again, and Shadow and Verity decide to
	find shelter together. On the way, they encounter a Charmander sitting on a
	rock. Shadow wonders who put it there when another person, Cross, appears,
	with a Midnight Form Lycanroc. He explains that since the Charmander was
	weak, there was no sense in keeping it, and so he left it out in the rain
	to toughen it up. Shadow is disgusted by this, and Cross walks away. Verity
	notes that the fire on Charmander's tail is extremely small-if it ever went
	out completely&#8230;The two resolve to find shelter, fast, and make it to
	a cave. Upon entering, they find that Sorrel had taken refuge in there as
	well. Sorrel at first becomes mad at Shadow for leaving the Charmander in
	the rain, but Verity explains the situation. Sorrel gladly agrees to heal
	the Charmander, and after feeding it medicine wraps it in cloth to keep
	warm. Shadow vouches to hold it to spread his body heat. The three begin
	discussing their pasts; Shadow and Verity are both on journeys, and Sorrel
	wants to learn more about the legendary Pok&#233;mon of Kanto. He proceeds
	to tell them both the tale of the Burned Tower, and how Ho-Oh resurrected
	them. He also gives a picture, which Shadow immediately recognizes. He
	pulls out the Rainbow Wing from his jacket pocket, and the two marvel at
	it. Sorrel explains that Ho-Oh gives the Rainbow Wing to a Trainer that it
	likes-a so-called "rainbow hero" that is destined to battle the legendary
	Pok&#233;mon-and suggests that Shadow travel to Mount Tensei, where Ho-Oh
	is said to come if a Rainbow Wing is placed. The three decide to travel to
	Mount Tensei together. Just then, Entei arrives in the cave along with some
	wild Pok&#233;mon, and takes up residence on an elevated spot in the cave,
	taking special notice of Shadow's Rainbow Wing. The three leave it alone,
	and Sorrel says that it's going to be cold despite the existence of a fire.
	He puts his Lucario back into its Pok&#233;ball, as does Verity with
	Piplup, but Shadow explains that Riolu does not appreciate being in its
	Pok&#233;ball. The other two Pok&#233;mon hop out of their Pok&#233;balls
	as well, and they all spend the night sleeping together.
</p>
<p>
	IV. Shadow convinces Charmander to travel along with him, and the entire
	party sets off towards Mount Tensei. They begin walking to a nearby town,
	but on the way, Caterpie evolves into a Metapod and Charmander evolves into
	a Charmeleon. Once they make it to the city, Sorrel begins to research more
	about Ho-Oh at the library. Verity also claims to have seen Suicune while
	walking out in the forest. Sorrel finds some information and shares it with
	the rest of the group. Shadow decides to fight some trainers at the local
	battleground while they're here and gets on a winning streak with Riolu.
	After defeating an XXX, Cross comes up and challenges Shadow, this time
	using an Incineroar. Shadow uses Charmeleon, believing that he could win
	through the sheer faith that Cross' training strategy is incorrect.
	However, Charmeleon is savagely beaten, and Cross smugly walks away. Shadow
	is unable to believe the loss, and openly admits that had he used Riolu he
	would have won. He runs away into the forest, the others chasing after him.
	Verity and Sorrel fall behind, but Riolu keeps pace. Shadow then says that
	he wishes that he had chosen a different starter Pok&#233;mon entirely, and
	Riolu stops following him, standing in one place while Shadow walks away
	until it is out of sight. Shadow asks himself if he even needs Riolu,
	sitting down against a tree. Marshadow appears and puts Shadow in a
	sleep-like state, the Rainbow Wing falling out of his pocket and becoming
	corrupted, devoid of color.
</p>
<p>
	a) Riolu is the first to wake up the following morning and immediately sees
	that Entei and the other wild Pok&#233;mon are missing. The others start
	waking up and when Shadow awakes he sees that Charmander's tail flame is
	back to full strength. Shadow asks Charmander if it would like to go with
	him, and after a slight bit of hesitance, it agrees. Shadow puts it in a
	Pok&#233;ball. They all decide to vacate the cave, and after looking at
	Sorrel's map start heading for the nearest town. On the way through a
	connecting forest, Charmander and Caterpie evolve into a Charmeleon and
	Metapod, respectively. Once they make it inside the (unnamed) town, they
	all head towards the library, where Sorrel begins researching more about
	Ho-Oh and the rainbow hero prophecy. He uncovers more information. Then,
	Shadow receives word that Trainers are having battles at a nearby
	battleground and heads over there to train. After defeating a few
	opponents, Cross comes up and challenges him. Shadow proceeds to denounce
	Cross' training methods and accepts the challenge, sure that he will win as
	he is up against incorrectly-trained Pok&#233;mon. Cross uses Incineroar,
	and Shadow uses Charmeleon-Cross comments that weak Pok&#233;mon that
	evolve are still weak. Despite Shadow's and Charmeleon's tenacity,
	Charmeleon is badly defeated, and Cross walks away, his point proven.
	Shadow can't believe his loss and is extremely upset despite Verity's and
	Sorrel's attempts to console him. He openly admits that he would have won
	had he used Riolu instead, and runs away into the forest. The others chase
	him, but Riolu is the only one who keeps pace; the Verity and Sorrel are
	left behind. Eventually, Shadow slows to a walk, still walking away, while
	Riolu tries to calm him down. However, it is unsuccessful, and Shadow says
	that he wishes that he had chosen Bulbasaur or Squirtle instead. Riolu
	stops following Shadow and stands while the latter continues walking away
	until it is out of sight. When Shadow glances back, it is completely gone.
	Sitting down against a tree, he questions whether or not he even needed
	Riolu, and sits down against a tree. Marshadow slowly appears from behind
	Shadow (he doesn't notice it) and possesses him, giving his eyes a purple
	glow and putting him into a sleep-like state. The Rainbow Wing falls out of
	Shadow's pocket, and Marshadow corrupts it, devoiding it of color.
</p>
<p>
	V. <em>(Dream)</em> Shadow wakes up in his room; his alarm clock did not
	work, and he had overslept. He quickly gets dressed in a full panic, not
	wanting to be late for the first day of school, and heads out towards
	Professor Oak's class. Once he makes it there, he says hello to Oak, who is
	watering some bushes. Oak comments that out of the four students who were
	late, he was the latest, and tells him to head to class. Once inside Shadow
	tries to listen to the lesson about math but loses his focus as he sees a
	flicker of something blue; his classmates Verity and Sorrel ask and when he
	replies, they call him weird. Once class ends, Shadow head to the rooftop
	and looks outside of the chain fence gate. When Verity and Sorrel come up
	and ask him why he's been looking out for so long, Shadow replies that he
	wonders what's beyond. Sorrel replies that it's the forest, a town, more
	forest, another town, and then the sea; he had never really given it any
	thought. Suddenly, the same blue flicker appears in Shadow's vision, and he
	starts looking for it; Verity and Sorrel are confused. The shape becomes
	clearer-it's Riolu-although Shadow cannot recall its name. Running after
	it, Riolu gets less and less transparent, until Shadow jumps at it and
	catches it in his arms, remembering its name. Suddenly, they are teleported
	above a meadow and begin falling. When they hit the ground, Shadow wakes up
	underneath the tree; Verity, Sorrel, and Riolu are surrounding him. Beside
	him, the Rainbow Wing regains its color. Once he spots Riolu, Shadow begins
	crying and hugs it, apologizing profusely to everyone. Suddenly, they
	perturb a group of Primape, who jump down and start tossing them into the
	air in their fury. Shadow releases Metapod and runs around the group with
	it, Metapod using String Shot to ensnare them. The group leaves, and on the
	way, Metapod evolves into a Butterfree. They make a small camp to last the
	night and sleep.
</p>
<p>
	a) Shadow is sleeping in bed, and in a dream throws his alarm clock,
	disabling it. He then wakes up and realizes just how late he is to the
	first day of school. He quickly gets dressed in a full panic, stopping for
	a second to appreciate the poster on his wall depicting three
	snazzy-looking cars, and heads outside of his room to tell his father about
	the ordeal. The two immediately head outside and hurry over to the school.
	Once Shadow makes it there, he sees Professor Oak, his teacher, outside
	giving water to bushes. After saying hello, Oak comments that out of the
	four students late, he was the latest. Shadow proceeds to his first class,
	where he attempts to focus on the current lesson: geometry. However, he
	feels that something is missing in his day, and catches a glimpse of
	something blue in his peripherals. He looks over, but sees nothing;
	instead, his classmates Verity and Sorrel ask what the matter is. When
	Shadow responds with what he saw, they call him weird. Once the class is
	over, Shadow walks up to the rooftop and stares outside of the chain link
	fence for a long time. Verity and Sorrel come up, Verity asking if Shadow
	ever got bored of the view. Shadow asks them what is beyond the school.
	Sorrel responds by saying there's forest, and then a town, and then more
	forest and another town; beyond that is the sea. Shadow is unsatisfied with
	the answer but doesn't press further. Suddenly, he sees in the corner of
	his eye that same flicker; his friends wonder what he is doing. The shape
	hops in and out of existence, barely a blur, but after enough focusing
	Shadow sees it a little clearer: it's his partner, though he doesn't
	remember its name. He begins to run towards it, the dream slowly
	disintegrating until it's just him and the shape. It slowly becomes less
	and less transparent. After catching up to it, he jumps and catches it in
	his arms, and remembers its name: Riolu. Suddenly, the two are transported
	to the skies above a meadow and fall to the ground in terror. When Shadow
	hits the ground, he wakes up in the waking world, still underneath the
	tree. Beside him are Verity, Sorrel, and Riolu, as well as the Rainbow Wing
	which is still in its place; the latter restores its color as the dream
	fades away. Once Shadow sees Riolu and recognizes it, he breaks down crying
	and hugs it, apologizing profusely for the awful things he had said. He
	gets up, and the group begins walking out of the forest. However, they
	disturb a bunch of Primape, who begin jumping down from trees all around
	them and start throwing them into the air. Shadow managed to get down and
	releases Metapod, running around with it in his arms while it uses String
	Shot to ensnare the Primape. Once they are subdued, the group runs away
	where they make camp for the night and sleep until morning.
</p>
<p>
	VI. The following morning, the group continues heading towards Mount
	Tensei. Eventually, they reach a cliff that shows a good view of the
	mountain before they hear a scream. Looking over to his left, Shadow spots
	a pink Butterfree being attacked by a Fearow and decides to save it. He
	throws his own Butterfree out of its Pok&#233;ball, and after a quick Gust,
	the Fearow is driven away. The two Butterfree hug, Sorrel pointing out that
	the pink one is female. The two say goodbye and the group continues on
	their way. When sunset arrives, however, Shadow notices that there is a
	flock of Butterfree that is heading off. Sorrel explains that it is mating
	season for the Butterfree and that this is the last time they will do this
	for a while. The pink Butterfree from earlier spots them and meets them.
	Shadow releases his own Butterfree, who does a mating dance. He comments
	that the two should go together, but Sorrel warns that if they did, it
	would be goodbye to Butterfree. Shadow realizes this but realizes that this
	is for the best. Through tears, he says that the two should go together,
	and breaks down crying as his first-ever caught Pok&#233;mon-and now
	first-ever released Pok&#233;mon-leaves. Despite the sad moment, the group
	pushes on towards Mount Tensei.
</p>
