# Shadow's Parallel

Shadow's Parallel is a mini-novel following Shadow, the protagonist, as he journeys through a recreation of *Pok√©mon: The Movie: I Choose You!*. 

Unfortunately, this is not open to collaboration unless I know you and explicitly want you on board. Sorry about that!

Of course, there is a big difference between a movie and a book. As such, some elements have been tweaked to better fit a novel setting. In addition, it is impossible for the book to be a complete copy of the movie's script, so some or all of the dialogue and actions will not be corresponding. Other than these two points, the book relies on the movie's plot.

Happy reading!
