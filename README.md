# Shadow's Parallel

Shadow's Parallel is a mini-novel following Shadow, the protagonist, as he journeys through a recreation of *Pok√©mon: The Movie: I Choose You!*. 

Unfortunately, this is not open to collaboration unless I know you and explicitly want you on board. Sorry about that!

Of course, there is a big difference between a movie and a book. As such, some elements have been tweaked to better fit a novel setting. Rest assured, 95% of the content is directly derived from the movie.

Happy reading!
