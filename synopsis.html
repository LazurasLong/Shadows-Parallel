	Synopsis
</p>
<p>
	I. Shadow wakes up late to receive his Pok&#233;mon from Professor Oak. As
	he arrives, he finds that all three of the starter Pok&#233;mon have
	already been taken by other Trainers. Professor Oak offers him a Riolu,
	along with the caveat that it has a problem. However, Shadow graciously
	accepts. The Riolu does not like Shadow at first, refusing to even enter
	its Pok&#233;ball, but the two of them begin their journey together.
</p>
<p>
	a) Shadow is sleeping in bed, and in a dream throws his
	Pok&#233;ball-shaped alarm clock, disabling it. Shadow's father then wakes
	him up late in the day, prompting Shadow to hurriedly run to Professor
	Oak's lab without even putting his regular attire on. Once he makes it
	there, he sees Oak outside giving water to an Oddish and Bellsprout. After
	saying hello, Oak recognizes him as being the fourth trainer of the day to
	receive a starter Pok&#233;mon. (Shadow is unbeknownst that the regular
	starter Pok&#233;mon are all unavailable.) Heading up the stairs to the
	central area, Shadow explains that he wants to pick a Squirtle, but Oak
	tells him that it was already taken. He counters with Bulbasaur; same
	response. No luck with Charmander. Shadow asks Oak what he could then do;
	would he start his journey without a Pok&#233;mon? The latter responds that
	he has one last Pok&#233;mon, but that it has a problem. Shadow counters
	that since he overslept so much, he has a problem as well. He notices a
	Riolu standing on the balcony above them and immediately declares it his
	new partner. He climbs up the stairs to greet his soon-to-be partner. The
	Riolu is hesitant to even say hello, however, and runs down the stairs.
	Shadow himself falls down the stairs, which prompts Riolu to laugh from
	behind Professor Oak. Oak introduces Riolu to Shadow, who then picks it up;
	Riolu responds by Force Palming Shadow and jumping out of his arms. Shadow
	is not deterred and Oak hands him Riolu's Pok&#233;ball, which has a small
	Aura sphere emblem on it. Ash's father then comes in, Shadow's clothes and
	gear in hand, and Shadow gets dressed in a jiffy. Shadow, full of energy,
	encourages Riolu to come with him, but it refuses. Shadow then attempts to
	put Riolu into its Pok&#233;ball, but it remains defiant, batting its
	Pok&#233;ball into Shadow's face. Oak then explains that Riolu hates
	getting into any sort of Pok&#233;ball. Shadow is determined to put it in
	its Pok&#233;ball, however, and the two of them rally it back and forth
	until Riolu slams it into Shadow's face again, prompting it to laugh.
	Shadow's dad chimes in, stating that if they're playing catch, they're good
	friends already, and Shadow agrees. He then picks up Riolu again, which
	makes it use another Force Palm that ends up hitting everyone. Shadow says
	goodbye to Professor Oak and his father and sets out with Pikachu, who is
	very reluctant to go with him.
</p>
<p>
	II. Shadow starts his journey off with a rough start, having to pull Riolu
	up a hill with a rope. Eventually, he gets fed up and unties it, asking it
	to walk with him, but it still doesn't like him. Shadow attempts to catch a
	Pidgey with a rock since Riolu refuses to help but instead hits a Spearow
	that aggresses Riolu. After fending it off, a swarm of a thousand Spearow
	begins attacking them, and Shadow carries a battered Riolu until he falls
	into a ditch. Prepared to take the full front of the storm for Riolu,
	Shadow stands up to face them, but just before they attack, Riolu jumps up
	and scatters them away with a blast of Aura. The two realize the
	relationship they have just formed, and just as the clouds clear Ho-Oh
	flies over them, dropping a Rainbow Wing that Shadow picks up. Shadow them
	vows to Riolu that one day they would meet that Pok&#233;mon.
</p>
<p>
	a) Shadow begins his journey with a rough start, dragging Riolu up a hill
	with the latter tied by a rope. The latter is apathetic as Shadow asks if
	it is going to be like this the entire way. He then asks it if it's because
	it doesn't like him, and it nods affirmatively. Shadow says that he likes
	it a lot and that he wants to become its friend. He does away with Riolu's
	rope and asks for a handshake, but it refuses; in response, he calls it a
	handful. Shadow then sees a Pidgey in the nearby grass and attempts to
	catch it straightaway, but it comes right back out after bobbing for a
	couple seconds. Shadow remembers that he must battle it first, and calls
	Riolu forth to battle, but the latter sits on a rock and does nothing,
	leaving Shadow to take matters into his own hands. He picks up a rock and
	aims for the Pidgey, but the Pidgey flies off and Shadow throws the rock
	after it. The rock hits a Spearow instead that thinks Riolu is the
	aggressor and begins attacking it. Riolu counters by using Force Palm and
	sending it away, but the Spearow goes into a large tree and a thousand more
	fly out, maddened. Shadow and Riolu attempt to run away but are not fast
	enough; the Spearow overtake them and pin Riolu down, repeatedly attacking
	it. Shadow fights his way to Riolu, telling the Spearow that he was the one
	they should be attacking, and picks a barely conscious Riolu up and starts
	running, the Spearow still chasing after them. As he keeps running he
	doesn't see an incoming cliff and falls into a river, still holding onto
	Riolu. He swims through the river, narrowly avoiding a Gyarados in the
	process. Clouds gather as he is in the river, very quickly covering the
	entire sky. Shadow resurfaces a while down the stream, still carrying Riolu
	and asking if it is alright, but the latter is still unresponsive. Just
	then, the Spearow swarm appears over the ridge, prompting Shadow to
	continue running through an open grass field. As he runs, he tells Riolu to
	hang in there, and a single raindrop falls on Riolu that resembles a tear
	before the rest of the storm breaks. The Spearow quickly catch up to Shadow
	and bat him around, causing him to lose his balance when jumping over a
	ledge and fall, dropping Riolu in the mud in the process. Shadow gets up
	and kneels over the battered Riolu, in disbelief that this was actually
	happening. He orders Riolu to get inside its Pok&#233;ball; even though it
	hated being in it, it would be safe in there. He doesn't wait for it to
	follow his order and gets up to face the enclosing flock. He then proceeds
	to shout, "All right, you! I don't think you know who you're dealing with,
	but I'm Shadow, from Pallet Town, and I'm gonna be the world's greatest
	Pok&#233;mon Master! Mess with me and you're gonna lose!" He declares that
	he will catch all of them at once. As the Spearow flock starts bunching
	together, Shadow pleads with Riolu to get inside its Pok&#233;ball, while
	at the same time taunting the Spearow to hit him with their best shot.
	Lightning strikes as the Spearow converge on Shadow, but just before they
	hit, Riolu climbs up Shadow's back and releases a giant burst of Aura that
	sends all the Spearow flying away. Both Shadow and his partner fall down
	onto the ground as the clouds begin to clear, revealing a beautiful sunset.
	Shadow brings Riolu close to him, and the latter licks him as a sign of a
	beginning friendship. Shadow asks if Riolu will stay, and it nods.
	Suddenly, a Pok&#233;mon's cry is heard in the distance, and Shadow and
	Riolu get up to see a magnificent rainbow-colored bird (Ho-Oh, but Shadow
	doesn't know its name) flying through the sky. It flies above him before
	continuing towards a newly-formed rainbow and drops something that Shadow
	catches: a glowing Rainbow Wing. Shadow then promises Riolu that someday
	they would both meet that Pok&#233;mon.
</p>
<p>
	III.
	<em>
		Time fast-forwards, a lot. Shadow now has two gym badges and is
		currently in the middle of getting his third from the Celadon Gym.
	</em>
	After defeating Erika, Riolu evolves into a Lucario and Shadow receives his
	third badge. Shadow then catches a Caterpie in the wild, then goes to a
	Pok&#233;mon Center to heal his Pok&#233;mon and talk to his dad about his
	accomplishments. He gets word that Entei is near and hangs up to go search
	for it. He comes across Verity who also wants to battle it, as well as
	Sorrel. None of them phase it, and Entei walks away unharmed. Shadow and
	Verity blame each other for letting Entei escape and battle while Sorrel
	walks away, claiming that it will rain soon. The former two disturb an Onyx
	that chases them until Shadow manages to calm it down. It then starts
	raining, and Shadow and Verity start searching for shelter before coming
	across a Charmander that had been abandoned by Cross. Shadow takes
	Charmander, and he and Verity find a cave where Sorrel also happens to be.
	After treating Charmander, the three Trainers begin to talk about
	themselves until Entei walks into the cave with other wild Pok&#233;mon and
	rests on another platform. Sorrel brings up the myth about Ho-Oh and the
	legendary trio (Entei, Raikou, and Suicune), and when Shadow takes out the
	Rainbow Wing, everyone is amazed. The three then agree to travel to Mount
	Tensei, where Ho-Oh resides.
</p>
<p>
	a) Shadow orders Lucario to use Extreme Speed right away, deep into his
	third gym battle against Erika, the Grass-type Gym Leader. Erika's Tangela
	counters with Vine Whip, but Lucario dodges the incoming attack and slams
	square into it, sending it crashing into a rock that is part of the
	scenery. Tangela is fainted and so Shadow receives the Rainbow Badge.
	Afterward, he goes to a nearby Pok&#233;mon Center in the woods and
	telephones his father, who berates him for not keeping in touch. Lucario is
	occupied with messing with a Bulbasaur that walks in, but once it walks
	into view, Shadow's father greets it as well. Shadow quickly loses his
	enthusiasm and attempts to hang up, but his dad continues to speak, asking
	if he was eating correctly, doing laundry, etc. Suddenly a Trainer comes in
	with a battered Vaporeon; they had attempted to battle Entei, who was near.
	Shadow's interest wanders away until he realizes he is still on call. In a
	panic, he hangs up and runs over to the other Trainer along with others who
	had overheard. The Trainer explains that he was looking for it since it was
	Legendary (and thus extremely rare), but the two of them were beat in no
	time flat; after that, it ran back into the forest. Everyone else starts
	running into the forest in hopes of catching it; Shadow joins them. In the
	forest, Shadow begins calling out for it until he spots it standing on a
	rock. He shouts, "There it is!", but another voice says it at the exact
	same time: A new Trainer (Verity), standing on a rock next to him! She gets
	a running head start as Shadow and Lucario start chasing after her. As
	she's running, Verity unleashes her Piplup. Shadow catches up to her and
	claims that he got here first, but Verity retorts with the same. Shadow
	runs up a rock while Verity continues on flat ground, making her the first
	to enter Entei's clearing. She has Piplup use Bubble Beam, which Entei
	dodges. It lands directly next to Shadow, who becomes paralyzed with fear
	for a moment before ordering Pikachu to use Thunderbolt. Entei dodges it as
	well, landing nearer to Verity (who falls down) before jumping a second
	time onto a mass of rocks. Shadow and Verity both run towards it, and it
	uses a massive Flamethrower targeted at both of them. Verity and her Piplup
	and Lucario all get out of the way but Shadow trips, catching his pants on
	fire. Entei jumps towards another Trainer (Sorrel) who has entered the
	clearing with a Lucario. He has his Pok&#233;mon use Aura Sphere, which
	doesn't do much despite being a direct hit. A second Flamethrower hits his
	Lucario directly and knocks it against a tree. Verity's Piplup uses Bubble
	Beam again, causing Entei to jump high in the air and land with a shockwave
	that knocks both Verity and Shadow down. Entei then bounds away. Verity
	accuses Shadow letting it escape. Shadow claims he could have caught it if
	she hadn't been in the way. Verity says <em>Shadow </em>was in the way, and
	Shadow says she was. Verity asks if Shadow would like to challenge her, and
	the latter accepts, formally introducing his name and hometown. Verity does
	the same, then turns to Sorrel (who is helping his Lucario up) and declares
	that he's next once she polishes off Shadow. Shadow says he wants to battle
	as well before realizing what Verity just said. Sorrel introduces himself
	while putting Lucario back into its Pok&#233;ball, saying that he'll pass
	on the battles. Despite the two's protests, he adds that it's going to rain
	soon while he walks away. Shadow is confounded that it's going to rain,
	while Verity taunts him to call his mommy. Shadow flares up and gets the
	battle underway, Verity doing the same. Shadow gives Verity the first move,
	but Verity tells him to not be a gentleman as he may regret it. She then
	starts of the battle by having her Piplup use Drill Peck; Lucario uses Bone
	Rush and the two bounce off of each other. Lucario uses Extreme Speed and
	slams into Piplup. Piplup responds with a Hydro Pump that Lucario dodges.
	The water instead hits a mass of rocks at the end of the clearing, but
	after a few seconds the rocks stand up; it's an Onyx! Shadow jumps for
	Piplup and picks it up, doing a roll to get back on his feet and run away
	along with Lucario and Verity.
</p>
<p>
	IV. Shadow convinces Charmander to travel along with him. The entire party
	sets off towards Mount Tensei, but not before going for a swim. Caterpie
	evolves into Metapod during a battle, and that same night, Verity sees
	Suicune and shares the experience with the group while they continue
	walking towards a town. Once they make it to town, Shadow begins battling
	other Trainers and Charmander evolves into Charmeleon. Sorrel researches
	more about Ho-Oh the following day and uncovers information about its past.
	Afterwards, Shadow goes back to battling until Cross challenges him with an
	Incineroar. Shadow uses Charmeleon, believing that he could win through the
	sheer faith that Cross' training strategy is incorrect. However, Charmeleon
	is savagely beaten, and Shadow is unable to believe the loss, openly
	admitting afterward that had he used Lucario he would have won. He runs
	away into the forest and Sorrel and Verity cannot catch up, and when
	Lucario disagrees with him as well it stops following. Shadow sits down on
	a tree, questioning if he is the rainbow hero before Marshadow puts him in
	a trance-like state. Beside him, the Rainbow Wing loses its color.
</p>
<p>
	a) Lucario is the first to wake up the following morning and immediately
	notices that the rain has stopped and that Entei has gone. The others start
	waking up and when Shadow awakes he sees that Charmander's tail flame is
	back to full strength. Shadow asks Charmander if it would like to go with
	him, and after a slight bit of hesitance, it agrees. Shadow puts it in a
	Pok&#233;ball. They all decide to vacate the cave, and after looking at
	Sorrel's map start heading for the nearest town. First, though, they go for
	a swim (minus Sorrel and Lucario, who stay dry sitting against a tree).
	Shadow ends up fighting a Pinsir with Caterpie, and after flinging the
	former down with a String Shot the latter evolves into Metapod. The Pinsir
	gets away, but Shadow is just happy that his Pok&#233;mon evolved. Once
	they make it inside the (unnamed) town, Shadow wastes no time going
	straight to the local battlefield, where he and Charmander face off against
	a Jigglypuff. Charmander wins and evolves to Charmeleon while running back
	to Shadow. The next day, they all head towards the library, where Sorrel
	begins researching more about Ho-Oh and the rainbow hero prophecy. He
	uncovers more information about the legendary Pok&#233;mon: long ago, Ho-Oh
	watched over the works of people and Pok&#233;mon, and everyone was given
	energy via an aura of happiness. However, a heart of evil touched the
	Rainbow Wing, and its color vanished. Shadow heads back to the battlefield.
	After defeating a Snorlax, Cross comes up and challenges him, saying that
	he heard a rumor that Shadow was using Charmander [<em>sic</em>]. When
	Shadow sends out Charmeleon, Cross maintains that weak Pok&#233;mon who
	evolve are still weak. Shadow is sure that he will win as he is up against
	incorrectly-trained Pok&#233;mon. Cross uses Incineroar, and Shadow uses
	Charmeleon-Cross comments that useless Pok&#233;mon that evolve are still
	useless. Despite Shadow's and Charmeleon's tenacity, Charmeleon is badly
	defeated, and Cross proceeds to insult Shadow, citing that he relied on
	cheap friendship and tried to use moves he couldn't use. Shadow has no
	retort. He can't believe his loss and is extremely upset despite Verity's
	and Sorrel's attempts to console him. He openly admits that he would have
	won had he used Lucario instead, and runs away into the forest when Sorrel
	calls him out on being no better than Cross if that was his mindset. The
	others chase him, but Lucario is the only one who keeps pace; Verity and
	Sorrel are left behind. Eventually, Shadow slows to a walk, still walking
	away, and declares the two losers. He asks if Lucario agrees with him, to
	which it says no. Shadow says that he wishes that he had chosen Bulbasaur
	or Squirtle instead. Lucario stops following Shadow and stands while the
	latter continues walking away until it is out of sight. When Shadow glances
	back, it is completely gone. Sitting down against a tree, he questions
	whether or not he even needs Lucario, and sits down against a tree. He
	takes out the Rainbow Wing and says to Ho-Oh that he thought he was the
	rainbow hero. Marshadow slowly appears from behind Shadow (he doesn't
	notice it) and possesses him, giving his eyes a purple glow and putting him
	into a sleep-like state. The Rainbow Wing falls out of Shadow's hand and is
	corrupted, losing its color.
</p>
<p>
	V. Shadow wakes up late to the first day of school, and once he makes it he
	finds out he is the latest of the four people to be late. During class, he
	is distracted by blurs of things in his peripherals. Once class ends, he
	goes to the rooftop, where he confides to Verity and Sorrel that he wants
	to see what is "out there"; he wants to go on a journey. He says that he
	will always have his buddy before realizing that his buddy no longer
	exists, and Verity and Sorrel disappear as he starts to cry. After seeing a
	vision of his partner, Shadow begins running toward it, running first
	through a plaza and then jumping across the ground as the world begins to
	crumble apart. After catching it mid-air, he remembers its name, Lucario,
	and then wakes up under the tree where he fell asleep. In front of him is
	Lucario looking concerned, and he hugs it, apologizing profusely and saying
	that it was all his fault. Besides him, the Rainbow Wing regains its color,
	and Verity and Sorrel begin to reprimand him. After doing so, Shadow gets
	up and together they move to elsewhere in the forest.
</p>
<p>
	a) Shadow is sleeping in bed, and in a dream throws his alarm clock,
	disabling it. He then wakes up and realizes just how late he is to the
	first day of school. He quickly gets dressed in a full panic, stopping for
	a second to appreciate the poster on his wall depicting three
	snazzy-looking cars, and heads outside of his room to tell his father about
	the ordeal. The former runs over to the school to avoid being late. Once
	Shadow makes it there, he sees Professor Oak, his teacher, outside giving
	water to bushes. After saying hello, Oak comments that out of the four
	students late, he was the latest. Shadow proceeds to his first class, where
	he attempts to focus on the current lesson: rainbows. However, he feels
	that something is missing in his day, and catches a glimpse of something
	blue below his desk. He looks over, but sees nothing; instead, his
	classmates Verity and Sorrel call him weird. Shadow also thinks he sees
	Ho-Oh in the skies, but upon closer inspection, it's just a plane. Once the
	class is over, Shadow walks up to the rooftop and stares outside of the
	chain link fence for a long time. Verity and Sorrel come up, Verity asking
	if Shadow ever got bored of the view. Shadow asks them what is beyond the
	school. Sorrel responds by saying there's forest, and then a town, and then
	more forest and another town; beyond that is the sea. Verity says that it's
	just more of the same after that. Shadow tells them that he wants to
	explore what's out there. Verity and Sorrel chime in; no school, staying
	up, absolute freedom&#8230; Shadow says that he always has his buddy, but
	stops himself when he realizes that his "buddy" no longer exists. He sees a
	vision of his partner on his shoulder and begins to cry. His friends tell
	him to pull himself together, but when Shadow looks back up, they're gone.
	Behind him, he sees that same figure, hazy but there. He begins to run
	towards it, and he suddenly finds himself running along a plaza. He says
	that they used to run like this all the time. The ground starts crumbling
	into chunks and falling into the void, and Shadow tries to catch up. He
	jumps and catches his partner, remembering its name, Lucario. Suddenly, the
	two are transported to the skies above a meadow and fall to the ground in
	terror. When Shadow hits the ground, he wakes up in the waking world, still
	underneath the tree. He immediately sees Lucario in front of him and hugs
	it, crying and saying that it was all his fault. Beside him, the Rainbow
	Wing regains its color. Verity asks Shadow if he had any idea how long
	they'd been searching for him, and Sorrel lectures him, saying that you
	cannot expect to win every battle and that it's the losses that you grow
	strong from, but that's just his opinion. Shadow gets up, and the group
	goes elsewhere in the forest.
</p>
<p>
	VI. As the group makes a camp in the forest, Shadow tells about the dream
	he had. Verity is in disbelief at a world without Pok&#233;mon, but Sorrel
	explains it's not impossible for Pok&#233;mon to leave us. He describes one
	point in his childhood when his parents were away most of the time and so
	the family's Luxray took care of him. One day, he injured himself out in
	the snow, and Luxray found him and curled up next to him to keep him warm.
	When morning came, Luxray was frozen solid. A rescue team then found
	Sorrel, and while he was being dragged away he was screaming Luxray's name.
	Marshadow suddenly appears behind Shadow and is noticed. Lucario fires an
	Aura Sphere at the spot where Marshadow was, but it had already rescinded
	into Shadow's shadow; instead, Lucario hits a tree, triggering a group of
	Primape to come down. The Primape get in a circle and begin throwing the
	group in the air until Sorrel advises Shadow to use Metapod to calm them.
	Shadow gets off and has Metapod use String Shot to stop the Primape, at
	which point the group dismounts and runs away. Metapod evolves into a
	Butterfree and uses Sleep Powder to ensure the Primape do not follow them.
	After reaching a river, Verity calls upon her Lapras, and they use it to
	travel downstream.
</p>
<p>
	a) The group makes a fire in a circular clearing of trees; a thin fog has
	rolled in, and it is still nighttime. Shadow is explaining the dream that
	he had, the others listening in closely. Verity is in shock at the very
	concept of a world without Pok&#233;mon. Sorrel, on the other hand, has a
	different perspective: it is possible for Pok&#233;mon to leave us. He
	describes a time in his early childhood: His parents were away most of the
	time, so the family Luxray took care of Sorrel. One day, however, Sorrel
	hurt himself outside in a blizzard and quickly started freezing. Luxray
	bounded across and laid down with him in the center to keep him from doing
	so. In the morning, when the blizzard was gone, Luxray was frozen solid; it
	had died smiling. A rescue team found Sorrel with Luxray, and as they
	carried him away, he screamed his protector's name. Afterwards, Sorrel was
	reluctant to make friends with any Pok&#233;mon, until he found Lucario.
	Shadow and Verity are somber after hearing the tale and offer their
	condolences. Meanwhile, Marshadow slowly appears from Shadow's shadow, but
	this time they spot it. Lucario is instantly aggressive and fires an Aura
	Sphere at Marshadow's location, but it rescinds long before it would have
	hit. Instead, the Aura Sphere hits the tree and shakes it. A group of
	Primape come down from the branches and quickly gather the team in a
	circle, repeatedly launching them in the air. Sorrel advises Shadow to use
	Metapod, as fighting back would only make them madder. Shadow manages to
	dismount the circle of Primape and takes out Metapod; he holds it and has
	it use String Shot, running around the ring. The aggressors are ensnared,
	and everyone dismounts before they can attack again. While running, Metapod
	evolves into Butterfree. Shadow has it use Sleep Powder on the Primape, who
	had broken out of the String Shot, and they all fall asleep. The group then
	continues walking, no longer threatened. They quickly reach a stream, and
	Verity gets out her Lapras. They all board Lapras and begin sailing
	downstream.
</p>
<p>
	VII. After more traveling, the group reaches a cliff that shows a good view
	of the mountain before they hear a scream. Shadow spots a
	pink-female-Butterfree being attacked by a Spearow. Shadow uses his own
	Butterfree to save it, and the two Butterfree hug before the pink one parts
	ways. After coming to a hilltop close to Mount Tensei, the rainbow wing
	suddenly glows, and a beam of light goes directly to the mountain. Once it
	becomes evening, they see a bunch of Butterfree traveling across the sky;
	Sorrel explains that it's mating season. Shadow takes out his own
	Butterfree, and the pink Butterfree hovers down to meet it. Shadow is happy
	about their relationship, but Verity explains the caveat: If Butterfree
	went with its partner, it would mean goodbye to Shadow. The latter suddenly
	becomes distraught, and Sorrel tells him that it's his decision. Shadow
	decides to let the Butterfree go with its partner and tells it that if they
	don't go now they will be left behind. As the blue one flies over to be
	with the other, Shadow says that they are both really great and that they
	should take care of each other. As they wave goodbye, Shadow and his
	Butterfree start crying profusely. It continues until the sun has set and
	no Butterfree are visible. Shadow comments that he is glad that he met
	Butterfree and that even though they said goodbye, they are still good
	friends. Suddenly, thunder crashes down behind them. Raikou appears on a
	rock above them, and in another flash of lightning, it is gone as quickly
	as it appeared.
</p>
<p>
	a) The group is still going downstream on Lapras' back when day breaks, but
	they eventually disembark and continue walking. As they are going through a
	forest and are about to reach a cliff, however, they hear a Pok&#233;mon
	scream off to the left. After looking, they identify it as a pink
	Butterfree who is being hunted by a Fearow. Shadow immediately goes to
	protect it, unleashing his own Butterfree and having it chase the Fearow
	away with Gust. When the belligerent flees, the two Butterfree stop for a
	second, the pink one thanking the other. Sorrel points out that the pink
	one is pink, as opposed to blue, and Verity concludes that it must be
	female. The pink Butterfree flies off. Once they are at the edge of the
	cliff, the Rainbow Wing begins glowing. Shadow takes it out of his pocket,
	and it lights a visible beam all the way to a mountain that isn't too far
	away: Mount Tensei. They're in front of another cliff when Shadow spots a
	swarm of Butterfree flying together in the distance. Sorrel comments that
	it's mating season for the Butterfree right now. Shadow takes out his own
	Butterfree, and within a few seconds, the pink one from before flies down
	to greet them. Shadow encourages their relationship, saying that they are
	awesome together, but Verity warns that should the two Butterfree go off
	together, it would be goodbye. Shadow becomes distraught at the concept of
	saying goodbye, and Sorrel states that in the end, it is his decision.
	Butterfree itself flies down to Shadow, who asks it if it wants to go.
	Butterfree responds after hesitation by flying behind his back. Shadow says
	that it should go with the other Butterfree and that if they don't go now,
	they will be left behind (in the background, the Butterfree swarm has
	continued flying some distance). As his Butterfree goes to be with the pink
	one, Shadow praises them, saying that they are both really great
	Pok&#233;mon (with a slight pause between "both" and "really"). As they
	begin waving goodbye to each other, Shadow and Butterfree both start crying
	profusely. They continue until the swarm has left; long after the sun has
	set. Shadow says that he is glad to have met Butterfree and that even
	though it's not here, they are still good friends. Sorrel comments that
	though people raise Pok&#233;mon, Pok&#233;mon live their own lives.
	Suddenly, a bolt of lightning crashes down behind the group. Turning
	around, they witness Raikou, the third of the legendary trio, standing on
	top of a rock looking down at them. With another flash of lightning, Raikou
	is gone as soon as it appeared. Their resolve strengthened, the group
	pushes forward to reach Mount Tensei.
</p>
<p>
	VIII. The group has made it to Mount Tensei, where there is much fog.
	Around them are many Pok&#233;mon, appearing agitated. Bonji suddenly
	appears from on top of a rock and explains that it's because they want to
	meet Ho-Oh. Shadow shows him the Rainbow Wing, and Sorrel recognizes him as
	being the author of the library book. Bonji says that for the past 20 years
	he's been on a quest to find Ho-Oh and that all of the data he's gathered
	points to Mount Tensei being the next place that Ho-Oh will be. They all
	start walking towards the summit of the mountain, and once it's visible the
	Rainbow Wing beams another flash of light that lights up the area ahead.
	Shadow runs ahead, excited. <strong>/</strong> At the summit, more
	Pok&#233;mon are gathered around, and Rainbow Rock is at the other end of a
	circular battlefield. Shadow slowly walks over to it to put the Rainbow
	Wing in but is stopped by Cross' Incineroar. Cross appears from behind
	Rainbow Rock and demands Shadow give over the Rainbow Wing, as the Trainer
	to battle Ho-Oh should be the strongest and that he was that person. Sorrel
	and Verity disagree. Cross replies with "might makes right, and that's it".
	The Rainbow Wing glows, and Marshadow appears and jumps to a ledge to
	"observe the proceedings", according to Bonji.
</p>
<p>
	a) The group is at the base of Mount Tensei, walking along through thick
	fog. Many Pok&#233;mon are scattered about, looking agitated, and Verity
	comments about it. Bonji suddenly says that it's because they want to meet
	Ho-Oh and receive its power. Bonji gets down from the rock he was on and
	starts sniffing the air, catching a faint scent of Ho-Oh. Shadow pulls out
	the Rainbow Wing, and Bonji is amazed. Verity is surprised that he knows of
	it, and Sorrel recognizes him as being the author of the book in the
	library. Bonji says his name, explaining that for the past 20 years he's
	been on a quest, searching for Ho-Oh being a part of his research. He
	elaborates that he's pulled data from many places and that the data all
	shows Mount Tensei to be the place of Ho-Oh's next appearance. They agree
	to travel together to the summit, and Bonji comments that the Rainbow
	Wing's shine is the shine of youth and that it's almost too beautiful for
	him to look upon. As they are walking, Bonji says that it's probably thanks
	in large part to the Rainbow Wing that the group has come across Entei,
	Raikou, and Suicune. He goes on to say that Ho-Oh wants to know if there is
	a young person suitable enough to be the Rainbow Hero, which means that
	there may be someone guiding Shadow from the shadows. Shadow recalls seeing
	one, and Bonji says that it's most likely the extremely rare Pok&#233;mon
	Marshadow. Marshadow is a guide from the shadows, and that when the Rainbow
	Wing's color fades, it seals it back up and makes it right. The fog has
	been getting thinner as they've been walking uphill, and suddenly the
	Rainbow Wing glows; when Shadow takes it out, it lights a direct beam of
	light to a crystal rock at the summit. Bonji prophesizes that when a
	Rainbow Flower blooms upon Rainbow Rock, Ho-Oh shall appear, and Shadow is
	overexcited, running ahead.
</p>
<p>
	b) When the group makes it to the summit, they find that more Pok&#233;mon
	are standing on ledges, waiting. There is a circular area fit for a
	battlefield, and in front of them is Rainbow Rock. Sorrel says that that's
	where Shadow should place the Rainbow Wing, and the latter runs over to
	plant it. However, Incineroar stops him, using Throat Chop in front of him
	to knock him back. Cross appears from behind the rock and demands the
	Rainbow Wing, saying that the Trainer who gets to battle Ho-Oh is the
	strongest and that he is said person. Sorrel defies that, saying that
	that's not how it works, and Verity chimes in, saying that the one to
	battle Ho-Oh is the one chosen by it. Cross calls them soft, using the
	jingle "might makes right, and that's it". Answering Shadow's questions, he
	declares weak people trash, and people that lose worse than trash. The
	Rainbow Wing suddenly glows, and Marshadow appears from Shadow's shadow and
	jumps on top of a ledge. Shadow recognizes it as being Marshadow; Cross is
	satisfied to meet the guardian from the shadow; Sorrel says that it's the
	Pok&#233;mon they saw that night; and Verity declares it cute. Bonji says
	that its only purpose is to observe the proceedings.
</p>
<p>
	IX. Shadow and Cross begin battling, Shadow using Charmeleon and Cross
	using Incineroar. <em>(See scene description for battle details) </em>
	Charmeleon evolves to Charizard mid-battle and goes on to win against
	Cross. Cross gets on his knees and returns Incineroar as Shadow starts
	walking to Rainbow Rock unabated. As he walks past Cross, however, Cross
	says that he had seen Ho-Oh too, but it didn't give him the Rainbow Wing.
	He asks why it had to be Shadow, and says that if Ho-Oh doesn't consider
	him the strongest, he'll crush it. Shadow says that he wants to be stronger
	as well, but that he only got this far with the help of his friends, so
	it's not just about strength. When asked what he even battles for, he
	responds that it's because he wants to make friends. Cross wrestles the
	Rainbow Wing away from him and climbs up Rainbow Rock, the Rainbow Wing
	losing its color. After placing it, a dark beam shoots up from Rainbow Rock
	and clouds cover the sky. Rainbow Rock and the ground both turn purple.
	Marshadow appears again and tosses Cross aside. Bonji says that Marshadow
	seals it up and makes it right.
</p>
<p>
	a) Shadow releases Charmeleon from its Pok&#233;ball to battle Cross'
	Incineroar. The latter immediately starts with Flamethrower, which
	Charmeleon dodges. Charmeleon retaliates with Slash, which lands a direct
	hit. Incineroar uses Throat Chop, and Charmeleon hops around unharmed.
	Charmeleon uses Slash yet again, and the two are locked in a power contest.
	Incineroar then uses Flamethrower, and Charmeleon is caught directly,
	blocking the flames. While in the Flamethrower, however, it evolves into
	Charizard. Cross doesn't care, saying that weak Pok&#233;mon who evolve are
	still weak. He continues with Throat Chop, and Charizard uses Slash; they
	end up hitting each other. Incineroar uses Flamethrower, and Charizard
	flies around to dodge it. Charizard uses Dragon Rage, and it's a direct
	hit. Shadow commands Charizard to build up its power to end it with a big
	attack. Incineroar continues the onslaught with Fire Fang, and Charizard
	dodges. While it's in the air, Incineroar jumps and grabs it to bring it
	down. Before it hits the ground, Charizard uses Seismic Toss and flings
	Incineroar across the stage. Cross aims to end the fight with Flamethrower;
	Charizard does the same. It's a fire contest, but Charizard's flame powers
	into a fully-fledged fireball and Incineroar loses, unable to battle. Cross
	gets on his knees and returns Incineroar. Shadow takes out the Rainbow Wing
	and walks over to the Rainbow Walk, but after he walks by Cross, the latter
	says that he saw Ho-Oh too. Cross continues, saying that it didn't give him
	the Rainbow Wing even after he's done everything to become the strongest.
	He asks why it had to be Shadow, and that if Ho-Oh doesn't consider him the
	strongest, he'll crush it. Shadow intervenes, saying that he wants to get
	stronger as well, but explains that he only got this far with the help of
	his friends, so he knows that it's not just about strength. Cross asks him
	what he even battles for, and Shadow responds that it's because he wants to
	make friends. Cross doesn't reply, instead running at Shadow and wrestling
	the Rainbow Wing away from him. He climbs up to the top of Rainbow Rock,
	the Rainbow Wing losing its color as he holds it, and places it where it
	should be. A dark beam appears from Rainbow Rock and clouds flood the sky.
	The ground turns corrupt and purple as well. Bonji comments that the
	Rainbow Wing loses its color when touched by one with an evil heart.
	Marshadow appears from the shadows and grabs Cross, tossing him aside;
	Lycanroc catches him. Bonji nervously repeats that Marshadow seals it back
	up and makes it right.<a name="_Hlk500260249"></a>
</p>
<p>
	X. Cross has Lycanroc attack Marshadow, but Marshadow fires a dark beam at
	it, mind-controlling it. It attacks Cross, who runs away, and just before
	it hits him with a ball of energy Charizard saves him. Verity explains that
	Charizard never forgot that Cross was once its Trainer. Marshadow
	mind-controls all the other Pok&#233;mon in the vicinity except for the
	group's, and they flee in response to attacks from them. While doing so,
	Bonji expresses concern and urges Shadow to get the Rainbow Wing back.
	Sorrel and Verity cover Shadow as he traverses the battlefield, dodging
	Pok&#233;mon's attacks. Lycanroc tries to attack him, but Cross knocks it
	over and it bites him; in doing so it is snapped out of its trance. Lucario
and Marshadow engage in a fierce battle for the Rainbow Wing	<em>(see scene description for battle details)</em>. While doing so, the
	rest of the group including Cross, who had a change of heart and helped
	them, is forced to retreat due to a rock slide. Marshadow changes form to a
	more colorful appearance and it and Lucario are locked in a power contest;
	Marshadow wins, and the resulting force knocks everyone back.
</p>
<p>
	a) Cross vows to pound Marshadow as well as he recovers from being thrown.
	Lycanroc uses Crush Claw, but before it makes it Marshadow fires a beam of
	darkness towards it; Lycanroc's eyes turn purple, and it turns around,
	mind-controlled. It starts attacking Cross, who runs away from it. Just
	before a ball of energy hits Cross, Charizard flies in front of him, taking
	the blow. Verity asks if he sees it now that Charizard never forgot that he
	was once its trainer. Shadow comments that it's just like Charizard to be
	awesome. Meanwhile, Marshadow fires more dark beams of light all around,
	mind-controlling every Pok&#233;mon around except for the group's. An
	Electabuzz fires a Thunderbolt towards Cross and Charizard-the two jump
	away in response-and a Pidgeotto flies towards Bonji, Sorrel, and Shadow;
	Sorrel's Lucario knocks it away. Bonji says that it looks as if Marshadow
	wants to control the group as well and that Ho-Oh will never appear now
	that it's come to this. At Marshadow's command, a group of Pok&#233;mon
	fire attacks at the group, forcing them to retreat. Bonji says that Shadow
	has got to get the Rainbow Wing back; Marshadow is getting its power from
	it, and only Shadow can get it back. Sorrel and Verity help defend Shadow
	while the latter starts making his way to Marshadow. Charizard
	Flamethrowers a Graveller and Magmar; Piplup uses Hydro Pump against a
	Pidgeotto; Charizard body slams an Arbok; Shadow runs on top of a charging
	Ryhorn; Sorrel's Lucario uses Bone Rush to block a Graveller as well as the
	Ryhorn; and just before it fires a Stone Edge, Cross tackles Lycanroc,
	pinning it down. Lycanroc proceeds to bite Cross' arm; Cross remembers that
	it bit him the day they met as well. He commands Lycanroc to remember as
	well, and it snaps out of its trance. Shadow makes it to Marshadow and
	demands that it give him the Rainbow Wing; it responds by leaping down from
	the rock and firing dark balls of energy at Lucario. Lucario retaliates by
	dodging the first two and hitting the third one back with a Bone Rush;
	Marshadow deflects it. The two engage in close combat, Lucario still having
	a Bone Rush, but Marshadow lands a blow, and Lucario is knocked back.
	Behind the two, Sorrel's Lucario is hit, but before the opposing
	Pok&#233;mon can do more damage Cross steps in with Lycanroc and counters
	an incoming fireball. However, a Nidoqueen and Nidoking both use Rock
	Throw, attacking the party with boulders. The defenders run away to avoid
	getting crushed. An Arbok wraps around Charizard's neck, incapacitating it.
	Meanwhile, Lucario is hit again with one of Marshadow's attacks, but Shadow
	is anything but deterred; Lucario keeps fighting. Marshadow begins glowing,
	its previously grey hair and eyebrows becoming green and red, respectively,
	and unleashes a flurry of energy balls. Lucario attempts to dodge them but
	is hit by one and subsequently all the others. Shadow responds immediately
	by having Lucario use Aura Sphere mid-air; Marshadow jumps in a kicking
	position. It is a power standoff, but Marshadow wins, and Lucario is
	directly hit. An explosion occurs from the energy exertion, knocking both
	Shadow and the rest of the party back.
</p>
<p>
	XI. Shadow runs over to Lucario, who is lying on the ground, as Marshadow
	stumbles and reverts to its original form. The mind-controlled Pok&#233;mon
	advance further on Shadow and Lucario as the former picks up the latter and
	runs away from them, backing them into a precipice. When he tries to run to
	the left, he is hit by a Flamethrower. The rest of the group is suppressed
	by other Pok&#233;mon, leaving Shadow to fend for himself. Shadow had been
	knocked away from Lucario by the Flamethrower, and crawls over to it and
	asks it to get into its Pok&#233;ball where it'd be protected. He leaves it
	and stands up to face the encroaching Pok&#233;mon, who are charging an
	attack. He taunts them with the same phrase he said against the Spearow
	swarm; as soon as he finishes, the Pok&#233;mon fire and Lucario jumps
	ahead to protect Shadow. Shadow stops it and buries it in his arms to
	protect it, and when the blast hits the two are knocked to the ground next
	to each other. Upon asking why Lucario wouldn't get into its Pok&#233;ball,
	it replies in English, "It's because&#8230;It's because I always
	want&#8230;to be with you." The mind-controlled Pok&#233;mon fire one more
	shot, and Shadow forces Lucario into its Pok&#233;ball and holds it tightly
	next to him. The explosion created is visible from many miles away, and the
	rest of the group gathers to watch. When the smoke clears, Lucario's
	Pok&#233;ball rolls away and Shadow's hat lands on top of it; when Lucario
	comes out of it, it's wearing the hat. In front of it is Shadow's body,
	energy flowing from it. The Rainbow Wing begins to disintegrate in
	Marshadow's hand. Lucario attempts to place Shadow's hat on his body, but
	once it does the body disappears into nothing; the Rainbow Wing vanishes as
	well. Lucario buries Shadow's hat in its face and cries out, unleashing a
	blast of Aura that engulfs everything on the mountain; it is so strong that
	the clouds fade and reveal a blue sky. The opposing Pok&#233;mon are no
	longer mind-controlled, and everybody looks at Lucario, crying into the
	hat. It shouts into the heavens one more time.
</p>
<p>
	a) Shadow immediately gets back up to see Lucario lying on the ground a few
	feet away and runs toward it; while he does so, Marshadow stops glowing and
	stumbles for a second. As Shadow crouches down, he sees that the
	mind-controlled Pok&#233;mon are advancing on him; he picks up Lucario and
	runs away from them until he reaches the edge of a ledge. Turning back, he
	sees his opponents all lines up, ready to strike. Shadow attempts to run
	away, but the Nidoqueen fires a Flamethrower at him and hits him directly.
	The others try to advance and defend him but are suppressed by other
	enslaved Pok&#233;mon; Shadow is all on his own. When the dust from the
	impact clears, Shadow is on the ground a few feet away from Lucario; the
	two begin crawling towards each other. Out of the corner of his eye, he
	sees the other Pok&#233;mon continuing to encroach, and takes Lucario's
	Pok&#233;ball and rolls it over to it, pleading for it to get inside. He
	says that he knows it can't stand being inside Pok&#233;balls, but it would
	be protected. The other Pok&#233;mon start charging an attack, and Shadow
	stands up to face them. He turns his cap around and says with perfect
	clarity, "Now you look. I don't think you know who you're dealing with. I'm
	Shadow, from Pallet Town, and I'm gonna be the world's&#8230;greatest
	Pok&#233;mon master! Mess with me, and you're gonna lose!" Immediately as
	he says the last word the Pok&#233;mon fire, and Lucario runs to protect
	him. Shadow sees this and stops it, instead burying it in his arms to
	protect it. He lets out a scream as the blast hits, and he is knocked to
	the ground, Lucario next to him. He asks why Lucario won't get in its
	Pok&#233;ball, and his partner replies in English, "It's because&#8230;It's
	because I always want&#8230;to be with you." The other Pok&#233;mon charge
	one final shot, and Shadow forces Lucario into its Pok&#233;ball. Holding
	the Pok&#233;ball tightly to his chest, Shadow is hit by the attack. An
	explosion ensues, so great that it is visible from several mountains away.
	The rest of the party including Cross gathers to watch, and Charizard
	flings the Arbok off its neck. When the smoke clears, Lucario's
	Pok&#233;ball rolls away, and Shadow's hat lands on top of it. When Lucario
	comes out of the Pok&#233;ball, the hat is on top of it. In front of it is
	Shadow's body, transparent with pure energy irradiating from it. The
	Rainbow Wing begins to disintegrate in Marshadow's hand. Lucario takes the
	hat and attempts to place it on Shadow's head, but as it puts it down the
	body fades away into nothingness; the Rainbow Wing completely disintegrates
	as well. When the last sparkles have disappeared, Lucario takes the hat and
	buries it in its face, crying out. A massive blast of Aura engulfs
	everything on top of the mountain; it is so strong that the clouds fade and
	reveal a blue sky. When the smoke disappears, the opposing Pok&#233;mon are
	no longer mind-controlled. Everybody focuses on Lucario, who is crying into
	the hat. It lets out a shout that reaches into the heavens.
</p>
<p>
	XII. Shadow wakes up in a sort of limbo where he died, the entire world
	including himself greyscale. Behind him is Lucario, crying, and he takes a
	step in its direction. Immediately the landscape changes; it is filled with
	color again, Shadow excluded, and is now a grassland. Shadow keeps running,
	and the landscape keeps changing as particles form in the place where he
	died in the waking world. As he begins running through pure color, Lucario
	jumps through a portal in the middle of the particles, and when the two
	connect, Shadow's color returns and a dazzling light engulfs the entire
	area. When it disappears, Shadow is standing with Lucario, alive and well.
	Verity and Sorrel run up to him, amazed that he is alright, and Bonji
	credits Ho-Oh. In Shadow's hand, the Rainbow Wing reforms, full of color,
	and he places it in its place on Rainbow Rock. A rainbow-colored beam
	shoots out as the ground returns to a light blue color, and a rainbow
	forms, Rainbow Rock being one of its bases. Ho-Oh appears from the other
	base, and when it makes it to Mount Tensei it showers everyone in a healing
	aurora. Shadow challenges it to a battle that lasts until the night. (No
	winner is declared).
</p>
<p>
	a) Shadow awakens where the final blast hit him, but one thing is severely
	different: the entire world, himself included, is grayscale. He gets up and
	asks where everybody is. He hears Lucario crying behind him and turns
	around. He takes a step in its direction, and suddenly the entire world
	changes: he is now standing in a color-filled grassy plain at sunset,
	though he himself is still greyscaled. In the waking world, particles begin
	to gather where Shadow's body was. Shadow hears Lucario again and starts
	running in its direction; the landscape changes again, the sky now being
	grey and the ground now being an endless grass plain. There are more
	particles where Shadow's body was, and they begin to move around more
	actively. As Shadow is running, he chuckles a little, commenting that they
	used to run like this all the time. The plain is suddenly filled with
	flowers as a small beam of light opens amid the particles. As Shadow
	continues running the sky changes to a blue color, and he starts running on
	top of water. The particles become more fantastic, and the beam enlarges to
	create a portal; Lucario drops the hat as it stares in amazement. Shadow is
	now running through a rainbow of colors as Lucario jumps into the portal;
	it appears in the sky in Shadow's reality as Shadow returns to running on
	water. Shadow jumps to meet Lucario and the two hug mid-air; once they
	connect Shadow's body becomes color again. The light in the waking world
	becomes dazzlingly bright, and when it fades, Shadow is alive, standing
	with Lucario. Verity and Sorrel run over to meet Shadow, and Sorrel
	comments that he's alright. Charizard also lets out a yell. Suddenly,
	particles begin gathering in Shadow's hand, and the Rainbow Wing reforms;
	the Rainbow Rock, as well as the floor, also return to a normal color.
	Bonji repeats that when a Rainbow Flower blooms on Rainbow Rock, Ho-Oh
	shall appear, and urges Shadow onward. Shadow climbs to the top of Rainbow
	Rock and deposits the feather; when he does so a brief flash of
	rainbow-colored light beams into the sky and a rainbow forms, Rainbow Rock
	being one of its bases. On the other end of the rainbow, Ho-Oh is flying
	towards them. Bonji continues speaking, now saying that the one who is
	guided by the Rainbow Wing may meet Ho-Oh and become the rainbow hero.
	Ho-Oh flies around in circles around the group, an aurora appearing that
	washes light onto them. Everyone's injuries, minus their clothing, are
	healed, and their power strengthened. Verity comments that it looks like
	everyone is healthy again, and Bonji chimes in, saying that it's the power
	of Ho-Oh. Meanwhile, Shadow nods to Lucario and yells out to Ho-Oh, "Let's
	have a battle!" The legendary bird tips its head and takes flight, Shadow
	and Lucario running over to take their place on the battlefield. Lucario
	and Ho-Oh engage in heated battle, which continues until long in the night.
	(No winner is declared.)
</p>
<p>
	XIII. The group goes to a Pok&#233;mon Center nearby where Lucario is
	healed. Once it is, Cross parts ways with them outside, vowing to battle
Shadow again and telling him not to lose to anyone until then.	<strong>/ </strong>At the top of a hill with a tree, where four paths meet,
	the group itself dissolves. Sorrel says that he'll be learning about the
	legendary bird trio, Verity plans to see her mother in Sinnoh, and Shadow,
	of course, continues striving to be a Pok&#233;mon master. Sorrel hopes
	that they will meet again one day, and the three say in unison, "Then we'll
	have a battle!" before walking their separate ways.
</p>
<p>
	a) The group arrives at the nearest Pok&#233;mon Center, and Shadow goes to
	heal Lucario. Nurse Joy asks who they battled this time, and Shadow
	responds truthfully. Nurse Joy unsuspectingly says that that's nice until
	she realizes what he just said; Shadow laughs in response. Outside the
	Pok&#233;mon Center, the group says goodbye to Cross, who vows to battle
	Shadow again. Cross tells him not to lose to anyone before then before
	walking off.
</p>
<p>
	b) At a four-way crossroads, the group dissolves itself. Sorrel says that
	he'll be going to learn about the legends of Articuno, Zapdos, and Moltres.
	Verity plans to go and see her mom again, and Shadow says that he'll go his
	own way, working to become a Pok&#233;mon master. Sorrel hopes that they
	will meet again one day, and the three say in unison, "Then we'll have a
	battle!" before walking their separate ways.
</p>
