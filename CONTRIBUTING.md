# Contributing

Contributing is fairly easy; all you have to do is write. It is preferred that you use Microsoft Word (if you don't, well, I can't guarantee that the exports are going to line up).

## Issues/Pull Requests

### Tags


#### `forgot`

This label represents something from the movie that the writer of the segment has forgotten (no worries, you can't be expected to memorize the entire movie!). Whenever a writer rewatches the movie, it is asked that they fill in information tagged with `forgot` (and of course any other discrepancies). This tag should not be added to a pull request.

#### `Chapter XX`

Self-explanatory, this marks which chapter the issue/pull request concerns.

#### `typo`

This marks the issue as explaining a typo in the manuscript/pull request as fixing a typo in the manuscript.

#### `discrepancy`

This marks that the affected segment deviates from the movie. This isn't a bad thing 100% of the time, but make sure not to stray too far; remember that the very purpose of this story is to be a recreation of the original movie.

### Format

Formatting the issue/pull request isn't rocket science. Just make sure to be concise and describe the purpose in the description. If the issue/pull request is long, please add an `h2` (`##`) to the top with a summary of the contents.
